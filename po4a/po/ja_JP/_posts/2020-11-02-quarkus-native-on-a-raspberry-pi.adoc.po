"When I've been introduced to Quarkus, back in December 2018, I suddenly had "
"the feeling the Quarkus runtime has the potential of covering ~95% of the "
"software use-cases.  My friend Sanne demoed Quarkus on his laptop when the "
"runtime was still in an alpha state, far from being the large, extended and "
"mature framework everybody knows nowadays. And still, I could experience a "
"new way of think, implement and deploy java apps."

"compilation process it definitely is the runtime of choice for IoT devices "
