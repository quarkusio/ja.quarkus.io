"Kubernetes Operators are quickly emerging as a new class of Cloud Native "

"react to changes on various resources and can be used to manage the "
"lifecycle of all kinds of complex systems like databases, messaging systems "
"and much much more.  On the implementation side, Operators benefit from "
"having a very low footprint as there can be potentially a very large number "
"of them running in a cluster."

"while also being able to create a low footprint native binary."
