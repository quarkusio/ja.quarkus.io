"From the outset {project-name} has been designed around a container first "
"philosophy.  What this means in real terms is that {project-name} is "
"optimised for low memory usage and fast startup times in the following ways:"

msgid ""
"Substrate support has been an important part of the design for "
"{project-name} from the beginning.  When an application is compiled down to "
"a native image it starts much faster and can run with a much smaller heap "
"than a standard JVM. {project-name} are all tested in Substrate, and can run "
"without the `-H:+ReportUnsupportedElementsAtRuntime` flag."

msgid ""
"As much processing as possible is done at build time, so your application "
"will only contain the classes that are actually needed at runtime. In a "
"traditional model all the classes required to perform the initial "
"application deployment hang around for the life of the application, even "
"though they are only used once. With {project-name} they are not even loaded "
"into the production JVM. This results in less memory usage, and also faster "
"startup time as all metadata processing has already been done."

"When running in a native image {project-name} pre-boots as much of the "
"framework as possible during the native image build process. This means that "
"the resulting native image has already run most of the startup code and "
"serialized the result into the executable, resulting in even faster startup."
