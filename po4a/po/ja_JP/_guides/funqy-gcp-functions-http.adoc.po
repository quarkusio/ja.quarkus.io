"If you want to allow HTTP clients to invoke your Funqy functions on Google "
"Cloud Functions, Quarkus allows you to expose multiple Funqy functions "
"through HTTP deployed as one Google Cloud Function.  This approach does add "
"overhead over the regular Funqy Google Cloud Function integration."

"Follow the link:gcp-functions-http[Google Cloud Functions Http Guide].  It "
"walks through using a variety of HTTP frameworks on Google Cloud Functions, "
"including Funqy."

"The Funqy HTTP + Google Cloud Functions binding is not a replacement for "
"REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy needs to be portable across a lot of "
"different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding is very "
"minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to "
"leverage HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may "
"want to consider using Quarkus's JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive "
"Route link:gcp-functions-http[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus "
"and Google Cloud Functions."
