"One of the highly anticipated features of Quarkus 1.1.0.CR1 was the GraalVM "
"19.3 support.  GraalVM 19.3 changes quite a lot of things (JDK 11 preview "
"etc) and due to the deep integration between Quarkus and GraalVM, it was an "
"all-or-nothing update for us as we couldn't support both GraalVM 19.2 and "
"19.3 at the same time."

"While porting Quarkus to GraalVM 19.3, we hit several regressions, some due "
"to Quarkus not doing the right thing (we fixed them), some due to GraalVM "
"regressions (we are working hand in hand with the GraalVM team to fix "
"them).  The next micro bugfix release of GraalVM is planned for mid-January, "
"so any workaround had to come from Quarkus and by writing substitutions."
