"This week, I've been asked about a widespread use case around concurrency.  "
"This user wanted to call two microservices _in parallel_, and when both "
"results are received, join them and continue the processing.  Basically, the "
"following pattern:"

"In a non-reactive approach, both calls would block the caller thread, and, "
