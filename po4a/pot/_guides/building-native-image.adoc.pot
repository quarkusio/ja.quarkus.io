"Building a native executable requires using a distribution of GraalVM.  "
"There are three distributions: Oracle GraalVM Community Edition (CE), Oracle "
"GraalVM Enterprise Edition (EE) and Mandrel.  The differences between the "
"Oracle and Mandrel distributions are as follows:"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

"Mandrel is a downstream distribution of the Oracle GraalVM CE.  Mandrel's "
"main goal is to provide a way to build native executables specifically "
"designed to support Quarkus."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_guides/building-native-image.adoc:36
msgid ""
"Mandrel releases are built from a code base derived from the upstream Oracle "
"GraalVM CE code base, with only minor changes but some significant "
"exclusions that are not necessary for Quarkus native apps.  They support the "
"same capabilities to build native executables as Oracle GraalVM CE, with no "
"significant changes to functionality.  Notably, they do not include support "
"for polyglot programming.  The reason for these exclusions is to provide a "
"better level of support for the majority of Quarkus users.  These exclusions "
"also mean Mandrel offers a considerable reduction in its distribution size "
"when compared with Oracle GraalVM CE/EE."

"Mandrel is built slightly differently to Oracle GraalVM CE, using the "
"standard OpenJDK project.  This means that it does not profit from a few "
"small enhancements that Oracle have added to the version of OpenJDK used to "
"build their own GraalVM downloads.  This enhancements are omitted because "
"upstream OpenJDK does not manage them, and cannot vouch for.  This is "
"particularly important when it comes to conformance and security."

"Mandrel is currently only recommended for building native executables that "
"target Linux containerized environments.  This means that Mandrel users "
"should use containers to build their native executables.  If you are "
"building native executables for macOS or Windows target platforms, you "
"should consider using Oracle GraalVM instead, because Mandrel does not "
"currently target these platforms.  Building native executables directly on "
"bare metal Linux is possible, with details available in the "
