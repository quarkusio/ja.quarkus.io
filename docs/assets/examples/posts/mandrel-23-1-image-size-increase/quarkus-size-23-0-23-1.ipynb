    "This article is a follow-up to [Exploring why native executables produced with Mandrel 23.0 are bigger than with Mandrel 22.3](../quarkus-size-22-3-23-0/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting with Quarkus 3.5 the default Mandrel version was updated from 23.0 to 23.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This update brought a number of bugfixes as well as new features like:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Preview of [Foreign Function & Memory API downcalls](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/docs/reference-manual/native-image/ForeignInterface.md) (part of \"Project Panama\", [JEP 442](https://openjdk.org/jeps/442)) on AMD64. Must be enabled with `--enable-preview`.\n",
    "2. New option `-H:Â±IndirectBranchTargetMarker` to mark indirect branch targets on AMD64 with an endbranch instruction. This is a prerequisite for future Intel CET support.\n",
    "3. Throw `MissingReflectionRegistrationError` when attempting to create a proxy class without having it registered at build-time, instead of a `VMError`.\n",
    "4. Support for `-XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError`.\n",
    "5. New `--parallelism` option to control how many threads are used by the build process.\n",
    "6. Simulation of class initializer: Class initializer of classes that are not marked for initialization at image build time are simulated at image build time to avoid executing them at image run time.\n",
    "7. and [more](https://github.com/oracle/graal/blob/master/substratevm/CHANGELOG.md#graalvm-for-jdk-21-internal-version-2310)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it also brought an unwanted side effect.\n",
    "The native executables produced with Mandrel 23.1 are bigger than the ones produced with Mandrel 23.10.\n",
    "To better understand why that happens we perform a thorough analysis to attribute the size increase to specific changes in Mandrel's code base.\n",
    "\n",
    "## TL;DR\n",
    "\n",
    "According to our analysis the binary size increase is attributed to two distinct changes, both of which are necessary for getting more accurate profiles when using the [async-sampler](https://github.com/oracle/graal/discussions/7707#discussioncomment-7443058).\n",
    "\n",
    "- [**Add support for profiling of topmost frame**](https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/7003)\n",
    "- [**ProfilingSampler does not need local variable values**](https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/6763) (specifically [the commit \"Always store bci in frame info\"](https://github.com/oracle/graal/commit/d747c30c7691012c39989a8597fd850c68b740ad))\n",
    "\n",
    "## Better understanding what is different between the generated native executables\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the analysis we use the [Quarkus startstop test](https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-startstop) (specifically commit `a8bae846881607e376c7c8a96116b6b50ee50b70`) which generates, starts, tests, and stops small Quarkus applications and measures various time-related metrics (e.g. time-to-first-OK-request) and memory usage.\n",
    "We get the test with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/quarkus-qe/quarkus-startstop\n",
    "cd quarkus-startstop\n",
    "git checkout a8bae846881607e376c7c8a96116b6b50ee50b70\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and build it with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mvn clean package -Pnative -Dquarkus.version=3.5.0\\\n",
    "    -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel-builder-image:jdk-17\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "changing the builder image tag to `jdk-20` and `jdk-21` for building with Mandrel 23.0 (based on JDK 20) and Mandrel 23.1 (based on JDK 21) respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason we also use `jdk-20` although deprecated is to see the effects of the base JDK when using the same code base (`jdk-17` and `jdk-20` are based on the same Mandrel source code but are built using a different base JDK version).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the build output (generated by Quarkus in `target/my-app-native-image-sources/my-app-build-output-stats.json`) the main differences between the three builds are in the following metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mandrel version | 23.0.2.1 (jdk-17) | 23.0.1.2 (jdk-20) | 23.1.1.0 (jdk-21) | Increase jdk-17 to jdk-20 % | Increase jdk-20 to jdk-21 % |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| Image Heap Size | 29790208 | 30982144 | 33546240 | 4 | 8.3 |\n",
    "| Objects count | 351565 | 353273 | 356059 | 0.5 | 0.8 |\n",
    "| Resources Size | 169205 | 174761 | 175392 | 3.3 | 0.36 |\n",
    "| Resources Count | 28 | 28 | 79 | 0 | 182 |\n",
    "| Total Image Size | 60006728 | 61734352 | 64224536 | 2.88 | 4 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Which indicates that the base JDK plays significant role in the image size increase, leaving the question open on whether the further increase in the generated binary size between `jdk-20` and `jdk-21` is due to the JDK difference or due to changes in Mandrel itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting that despite the resource count increase between Mandrel 23.0 (jdk-20) and Mandrel 23.1 (jdk-21) the resource size is not affected that much.\n",
    "As a result, we focus our analysis on the Image Heap Size which increases disproportionally to the objects count between the different Mandrel versions indicating that either some objects became bigger, or the few new objects being added to the heap are quite big.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "GraalVM and Mandrel provide the `-H:+DashboardAll` and `-H:+DashboardJson` flags that can be used to generate dashboards that contain more information about the generated native executable.\n",
    "The resulting dashboard contains a number of metrics and looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"points-to\": {\n",

    "      ...\n",
    "    ]\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the aforementioned flags we generate dashboards using both Mandrel 23.1 and 23.0 and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To generate the dashboards using Mandrel 23.0 we use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mvn package -Pnative \\\n",
    "  -Dquarkus.version=3.5.0 \\\n",
    "  -Dquarkus.native.builder-image=quay.io/quarkus/ubi-quarkus-mandrel-builder-image:jdk-20 \\\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to generate the dashboards using Mandrel 23.1 we use the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "mvn package -Pnative \\\n",
    "  -Dquarkus.version=3.5.0 \\\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Make sure to change `path/to/` to the path where you would like the dashboard json files to be stored, each file is about 370MB big.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. [**ProfilingSampler does not need local variable values**](https://github.com/oracle/graal/pull/6763) (specifically [the commit \"Always store bci in frame info\"](https://github.com/oracle/graal/commit/d747c30c7691012c39989a8597fd850c68b740ad)) which adds ~1.7MB of data to the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these changes are necessary to improve the accuracy of the [async-sampler](https://github.com/oracle/graal/discussions/7707#discussioncomment-7443058).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly to when Quarkus upgraded from 22.3 to 23.0, we observe an increase in the size of the generated native executables.\n",
    "Once more the changes resulting to that increase in the binary size appear to be well justified.\n",
    "As `native-image` becomes more mature and feature rich it seems inevitable to avoid increasing the size of the generated binaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think that this kind of info should only be included when the user opts-in, please provide your feedback in https://github.com/oracle/graal/discussions/7707"
