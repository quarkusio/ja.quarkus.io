" This allows for classes and other resources to be removed from dependencies, so they are not accessible to the application. This is a map of artifact id (in the form group:artifact) to a list of resources to be removed. \n"
" When running in dev and test mode these resources are hidden from the ClassLoader, when running in production mode these files are removed from the jars that contain them. \n"
" Note that if you want to remove a class you need to specify the class file name. e.g. to remove `com.acme.Foo` you would specify `com/acme/Foo.class`. \n"
" Note that for technical reasons this is not supported when running with JBang.\n"
