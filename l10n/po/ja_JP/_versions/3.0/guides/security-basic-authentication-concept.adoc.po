msgid "An HTTP user agent, such as a web browser, uses an `Authorization` header to provide a user name and password in each HTTP request.  The header is specified as `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials are the Base64 encoding of the user ID and password joined by a colon, as shown in the following example."

The credentials are merely encoded with Base64 when in transit and not encrypted or hashed in any way.  Therefore, Basic Authentication is used with HTTPS to provide confidentiality."

Depending on the use case, other authentication mechanisms that delegate username, password, and role management to specialized services might be a better choice."
