Instead, you can affect the lifecycle through declarative means, such as annotations, configuration, etc.  The container is the _environment_ where your application runs.  It creates and destroys the instances of beans, associates the instances with a designated context, and injects them into other beans."

In our example above, the `Translator` bean has two bean types: `Translator` and `java.lang.Object`.  Subsequently, a bean is assignable to an injection point if the bean has a bean type that matches the _required type_ and has all the _required qualifiers_.  We'll talk about qualifiers later.  For now, it's enough to know that the bean above is assignable to an injection point of type `Translator` and `java.lang.Object`."

However, a full CDI implementation is not used under the hood.  Quarkus only implements a subset of the CDI features - see also <<cdi-reference.adoc#supported_features,the list of supported features>> and <<cdi-reference.adoc#limitations,the list of limitations>>.  On the other hand, there are quite a few <<cdi-reference#nonstandard_features,non-standard features>> and <<cdi-reference.adoc#build_time_apis,Quarkus-specific APIs>>.  We believe that our efforts will drive the innovation of the CDI specification towards the build-time oriented developer stacks in the future."
