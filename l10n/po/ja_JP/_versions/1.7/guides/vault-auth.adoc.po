msgid "One drawback of this approach is that you expose a secret piece of information (i.e. the token) that can give access to sensitive data in Vault.

If an intruder was to access the client token, it would be able to start calling Vault on all endpoints permitted by the policy."

msgid "This risk can be mitigated using an approach called https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/response-wrapping[Response Wrapping] (which used to be known as _Cubbyhole Authentication_ in older versions of Vault). This principle is simple: instead of configuring the client token itself, we hide it inside a _Wrapping Token_, which we provide to the application. Upon startup, the application will unwrap the _Wrapping Token_, and fetch the real token from within. The additional level of security comes from the fact that the _Wrapping Token_ is short lived (from a few seconds to a few minutes; basically just enough to start and unwrap the token), and can be unwrapped *only once*.  If the _Wrapping Token_ gets stolen and unwrapped, we will notice immediately because the legitimate application will get an error saying that the token is invalid."
