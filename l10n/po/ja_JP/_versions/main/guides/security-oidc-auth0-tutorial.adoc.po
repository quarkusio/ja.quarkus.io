msgid "This tutorial demonstrated how Quarkus endpoints can be secured with the `quarkus-oidc` extension and Auth0 using Authorization code and Bearer token authentication flows, with both flows being supported by the same endpoint code.  Without writing a single line of code, you have added support for the custom Auth0 logout flow and enabled role-based access control with a custom Auth0 namespace qualified claim.  Token propagation from the frontend endpoint to the microservice endpoint has been achieved by adding the `@AccessToken` annotation to the microservice REST client.  Microservice endpoint activated the permission-based access control with the `@PermissionsAllowed` annotation.  You used Quarkus dev mode to update the code and configuration without restarting the endpoint, and you also used the OIDC Dev UI to visualize and test Auth0 tokens.  You used the continuous testing feature of Quarkus to complement OIDC Dev UI tests with integration tests against the live Auth0 development tenant.  Finally, you have run the application in JVM and native modes."
