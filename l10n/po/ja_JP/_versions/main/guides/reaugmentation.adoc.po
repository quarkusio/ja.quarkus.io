msgid "The augmentation is a phase of an application build process during which the byte code of the application is optimized according to the application build time configuration.  Initialization steps that used to happen when an EAR file was deployed on a Jakarta EE server such as parsing static configuration, creating proxy instances, etc. now happen at augmentation time.  CDI beans added after augmentation won't work (because of the missing proxy classes) as well as build time properties (e.g. `quarkus.datasource.db-kind`) changed after augmentation will be ignored.  Build time properties are marked with a lock icon (icon:lock[]) in the link:all-config[list of all configuration options].  It doesn't matter if you use profiles or any other way to override the properties.  The build time properties that were active during augmentation are baked into the build."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "Re-augmentation is useful in case the users of your application want to be able to change some of its build time properties.  For instance changing the database driver or switching features on or off (e.g. link:opentracing[opentracing] or link:consul-config[consul-config]).  If there are only two or three build time properties that depend on the user environment, you may consider providing alternative builds of the application. However, in case there are more such properties you may prefer shipping a mutable jar instead and let your users re-augment the application for their environment.  Please notice that you won't be able to use native images with the package type `mutable-jar`.  Think of the consequences and what other options you have!"

msgid "In order to run the augmentation steps you need the deployment JARs of the used Quarkus extensions.  These JARs are only present in the `mutable-jar` distribution. This means that you need to build your application with `quarkus.package.type=mutable-jar`.  The `mutable-jar` distribution is the same as the `fast-jar` distribution, except for the additional folder `quarkus-app/lib/deployment` which contains the deployment JARs and their dependencies (and some class-loader configuration)."

However, as of this writing changing `quarkus.datasource.db-kind` at runtime did neither fail nor produce a warning but was silently ignored."
