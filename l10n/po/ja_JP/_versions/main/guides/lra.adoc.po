msgid "The idea is for multiple services to perform different computations/actions in concert, whilst retaining the option to compensate for any actions performed during the computation.  This kind of loose coupling of services bridges the gap between strong consistency models such as JTA/XA and \"home grown\" ad hoc consistency solutions."

msgid "The model is based on the https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc#eclipse-microprofile-lra[Eclipse MicroProfile LRA specification].  The approach is for the developer to annotate a business method with a Java annotation (https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@LRA`]).  When such a method is called, an LRA context is created (if one is not already present) which is passed along with subsequent JAX-RS invocations until a method is reached which also contains an `@LRA` annotation with an attribute that indicates that the LRA should be closed or cancelled. The default is for the LRA to be closed in the same method that started the LRA (which itself may have propagated the context during method execution).  The JAX-RS resource indicates that it wishes to participate in the interaction by, minimally, marking one of the methods with an https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@Compensate`] annotation. If the context is later cancelled then this compensate action is guaranteed to be called even in the presence of failures and is the trigger for the resource to compensate for any activities it performed in the context of the LRA. This guarantee enables services to operate reliably with the assurance of eventual consistency (when all compensation activities have ran to completion). The participant can ask to be reliably notified when the LRA it is participating in is closed by marking one of the methods with an https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@Complete`] annotation. In this way cancelling an LRA causes all participants to be notified via their Compensate callback and closing an LRA causes all participants to be notified via their Complete callback (if they have one).  Other annotations for controlling participants are documented in the https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[MicroProfile LRA API v1.0 javadoc]."

It is the users responsibility to restart failed services on the same endpoint that they used when they first joined the LRA, or to tell the coordinator that they wish to be notified on new endpoints. An LRA is not deemed finished until *all* participants have acknowledged that they have finished."

To fulfill this task the coordinator must have access to durable storage for its logs (via a filesystem or in a database).  At the time of writing, managing coordinators is the responsibility of the user. An \"out-of-the-box\" solution will be forthcoming."
