msgid "Quarkus enables the inclusion or exclusion of JAX-RS Resources, Providers and Features directly thanks to build time conditions in the same that it does for CDI beans.  Thus, the various JAX-RS classes can be annotated with profile conditions (`@io.quarkus.arc.profile.IfBuildProfile` or `@io.quarkus.arc.profile.UnlessBuildProfile`) and/or with property conditions (`io.quarkus.arc.properties.IfBuildProperty` or `io.quarkus.arc.properties.UnlessBuildProperty`) to indicate to Quarkus at build time under which conditions these JAX-RS classes should be included."
msgstr "Quarkusでは、CDI Beanの場合と同様に、ビルド時の条件に応じて、JAX-RSリソース、プロバイダー、および機能を直接包含または除外することができます。したがって、さまざまなJAX-RSクラスは、プロファイル条件（ `@io.quarkus.arc.profile.IfBuildProfile` または `@io.quarkus.arc.profile.UnlessBuildProfile` ）および／またはプロパティ条件（ `io.quarkus.arc.properties.IfBuildProperty` または `io.quarkus.arc.properties.UnlessBuildProperty` ）でアノテーションすることができ、構築時にどの条件でこれらのJAX-RSクラスが含まれるべきかをQuarkusに示すことができます。"
