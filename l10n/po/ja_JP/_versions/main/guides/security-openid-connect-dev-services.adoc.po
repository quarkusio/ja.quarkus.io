msgid "Quarkus introduces an experimental `Dev Services For Keycloak` feature which is enabled by default when the `quarkus-oidc` extension is started in dev mode with `mvn quarkus:dev` and when the integration tests are running in test mode, but only when no `quarkus.oidc.auth-server-url` property is configured.  It starts a Keycloak container for both the dev and/or test modes and initializes them by registering the existing Keycloak realm or creating a new realm with the client and users for you to start developing your Quarkus application secured by Keycloak immediately. It will restart the container when the `application.properties` or the realm file changes have been detected."
