msgid "If any Kogito process-related extension is present (e.g. `kogito-quarkus` or `kogito-quarkus-processes`), Dev Services for Kogito automatically starts a Data Index in dev mode.  So, you don't have to start it manually or have any other service set-up manually.  The application is configured automatically, meaning that will replicate any Kogito messaging events related to Process Instances and User Tasks into the provisioned Data Index instance."
