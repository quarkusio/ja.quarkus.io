msgid "link:https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/specs/man/java.html#application-class-data-sharing[Application Class Data Sharing] is a JVM feature that helps reduce the startup time and memory footprint of a JVM application.  This is achieved by having the JVM create a pre-processed shared archived of classes that are loaded at startup time. As these classes are loaded every time the application starts, AppCDS is a conceptually simple way of improving the application startup time, without the application itself having to be coded or configured in a specific way. How much of an improvement depends on many factors, such as the number of classes loaded, the underlying hardware etc."
