"In this guide, we are going to develop two applications communicating with a RabbitMQ broker.\n"

"The first application, the `producer`, will let the user request some quotes over an HTTP endpoint.\n"
"For each quote request, a random identifier is generated and returned to the user, to put the quote request on _pending_.\n"
"At the same time the generated request id is sent to the `quote-requests` exchange."
