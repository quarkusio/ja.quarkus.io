"Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) uses HTTP headers to manage browser requests for resources from external origins securely.\n"

"The filter intercepts all incoming HTTP requests to identify cross-origin requests and applies the configured policy.\n"

"For preflight requests, the filter returns an HTTP response immediately.\n"
"For regular CORS requests, the filter denies access with an HTTP 403 status if the request violates the configured policy; otherwise, the filter forwards the request to the destination if the policy allows it."
