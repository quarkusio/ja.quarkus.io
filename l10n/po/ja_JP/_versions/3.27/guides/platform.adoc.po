In both Maven and Gradle, the effective set of the dependency version constraints (or the managed dependencies) is obtained by merging all the imported BOMs and version constraints specified individually in the current project and also its parent(s). The artifact `classifier` is a part of the dependency ID, which could be expressed as `groupId:artifactId:classifier:type`. Which means that if a project imports a couple of BOMs, e.g. `org.apple:apple-bom::pom:1.0` and `org.orange:orange-bom::pom:1.0`, and each of these two BOMs imports a different version `{quarkus-platform-groupid}:quarkus-bom::pom`, the Quarkus tools will be able to detect this fact and make the user aware of it, since it *might* not be a safe combination.
