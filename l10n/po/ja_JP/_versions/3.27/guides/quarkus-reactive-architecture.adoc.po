"Reactive System is an architectural style that can be summarized by: distributed systems done right.\n"
"Relying on asynchronous message passing helps enforce the loose coupling (both in terms of space and time) between the different components.\n"
"You send messages to virtual destinations. The receiver can be located anywhere, or even not yet exist at the time of the message dispatch.\n"
"The elasticity pillar allows scaling up and down individual components according to the load.\n"

#: _versions/3.27/guides/quarkus-reactive-architecture.adoc
msgid ""
"Traditional applications use blocking I/O and an imperative (sequential) execution model.\n"
"So, in an application exposing an HTTP endpoint, each HTTP request is associated with a thread.\n"
"In general, that thread is going to process the whole request and the thread is tied up serving only that request for the duration of that request.\n"
"When the processing requires interacting with a remote service, it uses blocking I/O.\n"
"The thread is blocked, waiting for the result of the I/O.\n"
"While that model is simple to develop with (as everything is sequential), it has a few drawbacks.\n"
"To handle concurrent requests, you need multiple threads, so, you need to introduce a worker thread pool.\n"
"The size of this pool constrains the concurrency of the application.\n"
"In addition, each thread has a cost in terms of memory and CPU.\n"
"Large thread pools result in greedy applications."

"As we have seen above, non-blocking I/O avoids that problem.\n"
"A few threads can handle many concurrent I/O.\n"
"If we go back to the HTTP endpoint example, the request processing is executed on one of these I/O threads.\n"
"Because there are only a few of them, you need to use them wisely.\n"
"When the request processing needs to call a remote service, you can't block the thread anymore.\n"

"Then, the extension dispatching that request to your code decides whether to call it on the I/O thread, avoiding thread switches, or on a worker thread.\n"
