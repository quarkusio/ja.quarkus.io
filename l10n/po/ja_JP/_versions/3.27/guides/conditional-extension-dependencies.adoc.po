msgid "Quarkus extension dependencies are usually configured in the same way as any other project dependencies in a project's build file, for example the Maven `pom.xml` or the Gradle build scripts. However, Quarkus also supports types of dependencies that aren't supported out-of-the-box by Maven and Gradle. Conditional Quarkus extension dependencies is one such example."
