"Quarkus Security uses `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` to extract the authentication credentials from the HTTP request and delegates them to `IdentityProvider` to convert the credentials to `SecurityIdentity`.\n"

"When Quarkus Security rejects an authentication request, `HttpAuthenticationMechanism` returns an authentication challenge to the client.\n"
"The type of challenge depends on the authentication mechanism.\n"
"For example, with the OIDC OpenID Connect (OIDC) Authorization Code Flow mechanism, a redirect URL gets generated, and the client is returned to the OpenID Connect provider to authenticate."
