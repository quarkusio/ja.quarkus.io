"You can also use other well-known xref:security-authentication-mechanisms.adoc#other-supported-authentication-mechanisms[authentication mechanisms], such as OpenID Connect (OIDC) and WebAuthn.\n"
"Authentication mechanisms depend on xref:security-identity-providers.adoc[Identity providers] to verify the authentication credentials and map them to a `SecurityIdentity` instance with the username, roles, original authentication credentials, and other attributes."
