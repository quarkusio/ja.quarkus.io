msgstr ""

#: _versions/3.27/guides/native-and-ssl.adoc

#: _versions/3.27/guides/native-and-ssl.adoc
msgid ""
"Creating a native executable using build time certificates essentially means that the root certificates are fixed at image build time, based on the certificate configuration used at build time (which for Quarkus means when you perform a build having `quarkus.native.enabled=true` set).\n"
"This avoids shipping a `cacerts` file or requiring a system property be set in order to set up root certificates that are provided by the OS where the binary runs."
