Complete the steps in the xref:security-getting-started.adoc[Secure a Quarkus application with Basic authentication] tutorial.  After you have successfully secured your Quarkus application with basic HTTP authentication, you can increase the security further by adding more advanced authentication mechanisms, for example, OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication."
