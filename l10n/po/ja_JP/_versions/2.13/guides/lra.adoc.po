"The approach is for the developer to annotate a business method with a Java annotation\n"
"(https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@LRA`]).\n"
"When such a method is called, an LRA context is created (if one is not already present) which is passed\n"
"along with subsequent JAX-RS invocations until a method is reached\n"
"which also contains an `@LRA` annotation with an attribute that indicates that the LRA should be\n"
"closed or cancelled. The default is for the LRA to be closed in the same method that started the\n"
"LRA (which itself may have propagated the context during method execution).\n"
"The JAX-RS resource indicates that it wishes to participate in the interaction by, minimally,\n"
"marking one of the methods with an\n"
"https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@Compensate`]\n"
"annotation. If the context is later cancelled, then this `@Compensate` action is guaranteed to be\n"
"called even in the presence of failures and is the trigger for the resource to compensate for any\n"
"activities it performed in the context of the LRA. This guarantee enables services to operate\n"
"reliably with the assurance of eventual consistency (when all compensation activities have\n"
"ran to completion). The participant can ask to be reliably notified when the LRA it is participating\n"
"in is closed by marking one of the methods with an\n"
"https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/[`@Complete`]\n"
"annotation. In this way cancelling an LRA causes all participants to be notified via their Compensate callback\n"
