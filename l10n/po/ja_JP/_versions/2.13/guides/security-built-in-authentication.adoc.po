"Quarkus provides form based authentication that works in a similar manner to traditional Servlet form based auth. Unlike\n"
"traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session, as Quarkus does not provide\n"

"be read by all members of the cluster (provided they all share the same encryption key)."

"value. This cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their\n"
