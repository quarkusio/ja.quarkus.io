"If you turn off proactive authentication, the authentication process runs only when an identity is requested.\n"
"An identity can be requested because of security rules that require the user to authenticate or because programmatic access to the current identity is required."

"If proactive authentication is used, accessing `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation.\n"
"This is because authentication might have yet to happen, and accessing `SecurityIdentity` might require calls to external systems, such as databases, that might block the operation.\n"
"For blocking applications, this is not an issue.\n"
"However, if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application, this fails because you cannot do blocking operations on the I/O thread.\n"
"To work around this, you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method.\n"
"Then, you can subscribe to the resulting `Uni` to be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."

"You can still access `SecurityIdentity` synchronously with `public SecurityIdentity getIdentity()` in xref:resteasy-reactive.adoc[RESTEasy Reactive] from endpoints that are annotated with `@RolesAllowed`, `@Authenticated`, or with respective configuration authorization checks because authentication has already happened.\n"

"Some HTTP authentication mechanisms must handle authentication exceptions themselves to create a correct authentication challenge.\n"
"For example, `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.CodeAuthenticationMechanism`, which manages OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow authentication, must build a correct redirect URL and set a state cookie.\n"
"Therefore, avoid using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms.\n"
"Instead, a safer approach is to ensure that proactive authentication is enabled and to use Vert.x HTTP route failure handlers.\n"
"This is because events come to the handler with the correct response status and headers.\n"
"Then, you must only customize the response; for example:"
