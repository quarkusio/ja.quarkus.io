The answer is, it depends on your DB and how many SQL SELECTs you are making.  No transaction means the DB does have a single operation transaction context anyway. + Third, when you do several SELECTs, it's better to wrap them in a single transaction because they will all be consistent with one another.  Say your DB represents your car dashboard, you can see the number of kilometers remaining and the fuel gauge level.  By reading it in one transaction, they will be consistent.  If you read one and the other from two different transactions, then they can be inconsistent.  It can be more dramatic if you read data related to rights and access management for example."
