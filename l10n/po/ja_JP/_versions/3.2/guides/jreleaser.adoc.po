This is because we did not assemble all required artifacts, yet the plugin expects them to be readily available. Here you have the choice to build the required artifacts on other nodes then copy them to their expected locations -- a task that can be performed running a GitHub Actions workflow on multiple nodes. Or you can instruct JReleaser to ignore some artifacts and select only those that match your current platform.
