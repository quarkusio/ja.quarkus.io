msgid "The most straightforward approach is obviously to inject the bean directly. This should work just fine for most applications. However, the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean, and all DAO beans that depend on it, might take some time to initialize before they can be used for the first time, and this process is blocking."

msgid "Fortunately, it is possible to control when the initialization should happen: the `quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init` parameter determines if the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean should be initialized on its first access (lazy) or when the application is starting (eager). The default value of this parameter is `false`, meaning the init process is lazy: the `QuarkusCqlSession` bean will be initialized lazily on its first access – for example, when there is a first REST request that needs to interact with the Cassandra database."

msgid "Using lazy initialization speeds up your application startup time, and avoids startup failures if the Cassandra database is not available. However, it could also prove dangerous if your code is fully non-blocking, for example if it uses xref:reactive-routes.adoc[reactive routes].  Indeed, the lazy initialization could accidentally happen on a thread that is not allowed to block, such as a Vert.x event loop thread. Therefore, setting `quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init` to `false` and injecting `QuarkusCqlSession` should be avoided in these contexts."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_versions/3.2/guides/cassandra.adoc:842
msgid "If you want to use Vert.x (or any other non-blocking framework) and keep the lazy initialization behavior, you should instead inject only a `CompletionStage` or a `Uni` of the desired bean. When injecting these beans, the initialization process will be triggered lazily, but it will happen in the background, in a non-blocking way, leveraging the Vert.x event loop. This way you don't risk blocking the Vert.x thread."

msgid "Alternatively, you can set `quarkus.cassandra.init.eager-init` to true: in this case the session bean and all DAO beans will be initialized eagerly during application startup, on the Quarkus main thread. This would eliminate any risk of blocking a Vert.x thread, at the cost of making your startup time (much) longer."
