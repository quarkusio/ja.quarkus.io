msgid "One of the key differences between HotSpot’s Serial GC and GraalVM’s Serial GC is the way they perform full GC cycles.  In HotSpot the algorithm used is mark-sweep-compact whereas in GraalVM it is mark-copy.  Both need to traverse all live objects, but in mark-copy this traversal is also used to copy live objects to a secondary space or semi-space.  As objects are copied from one semi-space to another they’re also compacted.  In mark-sweep-compact, the compacting requires a second pass on the live objects.  This makes full GCs in mark-copy more time efficient (in terms of time spent in each GC cycle) than mark-sweep-compact.  The tradeoff mark-copy makes in order to make individual full GC cycles shorter is space.  The use of semi-spaces means that for an application to maintain the same GC performance that mark-sweep achieves (in terms of allocated MB per second), it requires double the amount of memory."

msgid "Up to version 2.13, Quarkus used the “space/time” GC collection policy by default, but starting with version 2.14, it switched to using the “adaptive” policy instead.  The reason why Quarkus initially chose to use \"space/time\" is because at that time it had considerable performance improvements over \"adaptive\".  Recent performance experiments, however, indicate that the \"space/time\" policy can result in worse out-of-the-box experience compared to the \"adaptive\" policy, while at the same time the benefits it used to offer have diminished considerably after improvements made to the \"adaptive\" policy.  As a result, the \"adaptive\" policy appears to be the best option for most, if not all, Quarkus applications.  Full details on this switch can be read in link:https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus/issues/28267[this issue]."

In native executables generated by GraalVM's `native-image`, the heap is allocated using either aligned or unaligned heap chunks.  All non-array objects get allocated in thread local aligned chunks.  Each of these are 1MB in size by default.  For arrays, if they are bigger than 1/8 of the aligned chunk size, they will be allocated in unaligned heap chunks which have a size dependant on the object itself.  The very first time a thread allocates an object or small array, it will request an aligned heap chunk that it will use exclusively until it has run out of space in that chunk, in which case it will request another aligned heap chunk.  So by tracing these system calls, the code paths that end up requesting new aligned or unaligned heap chunks will be recorded.

A big chunk of this memory is Java heap, but extra memory is required for other aspects of the JVM that runs the native building process.  It is still possible to build such applications in environments that have total memory close to the limits, but to do that it is necessary to shrink the maximum heap size of the GraalVM native image process.  To do that, set a maximum heap size using the `quarkus.native.native-image-xmx` property.

So, it has to be able to recompile code if loading of new classes implies that it needs to revise optimistic assumptions made at compile time.  For example, if an interface has only one implementation it can make a call jump directly to that code.  However, in the case where a second implementation class is loaded the call site needs to be patched to test the type of the receiver instance and jump to the code that belongs to its class.  Supporting optimizations like this one requires keeping track of a lot more details of the class base than a native executable, including recording the full class and interface hierarchy, details of which methods override other methods, all method bytecode etc.  In a native executable most of the details of class structure and bytecode can be ignored at run time."

At that point the JVM has to jump out of the compiled code into the interpreter and recompile the code to cater for a new execution profile that includes the previously cold path.  That requires keeping runtime info that allow a compiled stack frame to be replaced with one or more interpreter frames.  It also requires runtime extensible profile counters to be allocated and updated to track what has or has not been executed."
