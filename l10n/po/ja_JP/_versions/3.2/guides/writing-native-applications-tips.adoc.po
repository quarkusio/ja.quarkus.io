msgid "During native executable build time GraalVM analyses the application's call tree and generates a code-set that includes all the code it needs.  Having a modular codebase is key to avoiding problems with unused or optional parts of your application, while at the same time reducing both native executable build times and size.  In this section you will learn about the details behind the benefits of modularity for native applications."

msgid "When code is not modular enough, generated native executables can end up with more code than what the user needs.  If a feature is not used and the code gets compiled into the native executable, this is a waste of native compilation time and memory usage, as well as native executable disk space and starting heap size.  Even more problems arise when third party libraries or specialized API subsystems are used which cause native compilation or runtime errors, and their use is not modularised enough.  A recent problem can be found in the JAXB library, which is capable of deserializing XML files containing images using Java’s AWT APIs.  The vast majority of Quarkus XML users don’t need to deserialize images, so there shouldn’t be a need for users applications to include Java AWT code, unless they specifically configure Quarkus to add the JAXB AWT code to the native executable.  However, because JAXB code that uses AWT is in the same jar as the rest of the XML parsing code, achieving this separation was rather complex and required the use of Java bytecode substitutions to get around it.  These substitutions are hard to maintain and can easily break, hence they should be one's last resort."

Taking the JAXB/AWT problem above, if the JAXB code that dealt with images was in a separate module or jar (e.g. `jaxb-images`), then Quarkus could choose not to include that module unless the user specifically requested the need to serialize/deserialize XML files containing images at build time."
