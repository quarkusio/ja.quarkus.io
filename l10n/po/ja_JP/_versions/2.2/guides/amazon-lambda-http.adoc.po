You have can full control how security metadata in the lambda HTTP event is mapped to Quarkus security APIs using implementations of the `io.quarkus.amazon.lambda.http.LambdaIdentityProvider` interface.  By implementing this interface, you can do things like define role mappings for your principal or publish additional attributes provided by IAM or Cognito or your Custom Lambda security integration."
