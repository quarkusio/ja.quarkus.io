msgid "The Quarkus class loading architecture is slightly different depending on the mode that the application is run in. When running a production application everything is loaded in the system ClassLoader, so it is a completely flat class path. This also applies to native image mode which does not really support multiple ClassLoaders, and is based on a normal production Quarkus application."

This can cause problems, as if these artifacts end up in the dependency tree out of date classes can be loaded that are not compatible with Quarkus.
