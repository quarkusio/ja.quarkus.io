msgid "Micrometer defines a core library providing a registration mechanism for Metrics, and core metric types (Counters, Gauges, Timers, Distribution Summaries, etc.). These core types provide an abstraction layer that can be adapted to different backend monitoring systems. In essence, your application (or a library) can `register` a `Counter`, `Gauge`, `Timer`, or `DistributionSummary` with a `MeterRegistry`. Micrometer will then delegate that registration to one or more implementations, where each implementation handles the unique considerations for the associated monitoring stack."

msgid "Micrometer uses naming conventions to translate between registered Meters and the conventions used by various backend registries. Meter names, for example, should be created and named using dots to separate segments, `a.name.like.this`.  Micrometer then translates that name into the format that the selected registry prefers. Prometheus uses underscores, which means the previous name will appear as `a_name_like_this` in Prometheus-formatted metrics output."
