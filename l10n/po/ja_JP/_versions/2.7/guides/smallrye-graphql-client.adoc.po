The client is implemented by the https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-graphql/[SmallRye GraphQL] project.  This guide is specifically geared towards the client side, so if you need an introduction to GraphQL in general, first refer to the xref:smallrye-graphql.adoc[SmallRye GraphQL guide], which provides an introduction to the GraphQL query language, general concepts and server-side development."

It's available at https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql[this webpage] if you want to experiment with it manually.  The web UI allows you to write and execute GraphQL queries against it."

msgid "The *typesafe* client works very much like the MicroProfile REST Client adjusted for calling GraphQL endpoints.  A client instance is basically a proxy that you can call like a regular Java object, but under the hood, the call will be translated to a GraphQL operation. It works with domain classes directly.  Any input and output objects for the operation will be translated to/from their representations in the GraphQL query language."

msgid "The *dynamic* client, on the other hand, works rather like an equivalent of the JAX-RS client from the `javax.ws.rs.client` package. It does not require the domain classes to work, it works with abstract representations of GraphQL documents instead. Documents are built using a domain-specific language (DSL).  The exchanged objects are treated as an abstract `JsonObject`, but, when necessary, it is possible to convert them to concrete model objects (if suitable model classes are available)."
