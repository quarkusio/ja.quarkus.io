In case of a Quarkus application, however, this command will list only the runtime dependencies of the application.  Given that the Quarkus build process adds deployment dependencies of the extensions used in the application to the original application classpath, it could be useful to know which dependencies and which versions end up on the build classpath.  Luckily, the `quarkus` Maven plugin includes the `dependency-tree` goal which displays the build dependency tree for the application."
