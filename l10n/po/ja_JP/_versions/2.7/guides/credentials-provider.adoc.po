msgid "Using a Credentials Provider"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text

msgid "Interacting with a datastore typically implies first connecting using credentials.  Those credentials will allow the client to be identified, authenticated and eventually authorized.  Username/password based authentication is very common, but that is not by any means the only one.  Such credentials information may appear in the application configuration, but it is becoming increasingly popular to store this type of sensitive information in secure stores, such as HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault or the AWS Secrets Manager to name just a few."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_versions/2.7/guides/credentials-provider.adoc:23
msgid "To bridge datastores that consume credentials, which can take different forms, and secure stores that provide those credentials, Quarkus introduces an intermediate abstraction called `Credentials Provider`, that some extensions may support to consume credentials (e.g. `agroal`), and some others may implement to produce credentials (e.g. `vault`)."
