With Mutiny everything is event-driven: you receive events, and you react to them.  This event-driven aspect embraces the asynchronous nature of distributed systems and provides an elegant and precise way to express continuation."

You observe them (_subscription_) and you get notified when they emit an item, a failure, or, in the case of a bounded Multi, a completion event.  When you (the subscriber) receive the event, you can process it (e.g., transform it, filter it).  With Mutiny, you are going to write code like _onX().action()_, which reads as “on item X do action”."

msgid "The `add` method inserts an element in the collection.  It receives the element as a parameter and uses the reactive API of the collection.  Interacting with the database involves I/Os.  The reactive principles forbid blocking while waiting for the interaction to complete.  Instead, we schedule the operation and pass a continuation.  The `insertOne` method returns a Uni, i.e., an asynchronous operation.  That's the scheduled I/O. We now need to express the continuation, which is done using the `.onItem()` method.  `.onItem()` allows configuring what needs to happen when the observed Uni emits an item, in our case when the scheduled I/Os completes.  In this example, we extract the inserted document id.  The final step is the subscription.  Without it, nothing would ever happen. Subscribing triggers the operation.  The subscription method can also define handlers: the `id` value on success, or a failure when the insertion fails."

As for the insertion, getting the stored elements involves I/Os.  The `find` is our operation.  As for Uni, you need to subscribe to trigger the operation.  The subscriber receives item events, a failure event, or a completion event when all the elements have been received."
