msgid "Since `Deployment` is a Kubernetes resource and not Openshift specific, it can't possibly leverage `ImageStream` resources, as is the case with `DeploymentConfig`. This means that the image references need to include the container image registry that hosts the image.  When the image is built, using Openshift builds (s2i binary and docker strategy) the Openshift internral image registry `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000` will be used, unless an other registry has been explicitly specified by the user. Please note, that in the internal registry the project/namespace name is added as part of the image repository: `image-registry.openshift-image-registry.svc:5000/<project name>/<name>:<tag>`, so users will need to make sure that the target project/namespace name is aligned with the `quarkus.container-image.group`."
