As new classes are discovered, some of them will be initialized during this process depending on the configuration.  In the next step, the heap is snapshotted and checks are made to see which types need to be available at runtime.  The initialization and heap snapshotting can cause new types to be discovered, in which case the process is repeated.  The process stops when a fixed point is reached, that is when the reachable program grows no more."

That includes the opportunities to inline a lot more of the code, locate hot code on direct paths (i.e. ensure better instruction cache locality)  and cut out a lot of the code on cold paths (on the JVM a lot of code does not get compiled until something tries to execute it -- it is replaced with a trap that causes deoptimization and recompilation).  Removal of cold paths provides many more optimization opportunities than are available for ahead of time compilation because it significantly reduces the branch complexity and combinatorial logic of the smaller amount of hot code that is compiled."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "By contrast, native executable compilation has to cater for all possible execution paths when it compiles code offline since it does not know which are the hot or cold paths and cannot use the trick of planting a trap and recompiling if it is hit. For the same reason it cannot load the dice to ensure that code cache conflicts are minimized by co-locating hot paths adjacent.  Native executable generation is able to remove some code because of the closed world hypothesis but that is often not enough to make up for all the benefits that profiling and runtime deopt & recompile provides to the JVM JIT compiler."

msgid "There are several reasons for 3). The JVM does not have a closed world assumption.  So, it has to be able to recompile code if loading of new classes implies that it needs to revise optimistic assumptions made at compile time.  For example, if an interface has only one implementation it can make a call jump directly to that code.  However, in the case where a second implementation class is loaded the call site needs to be patched to test the type of the receiver instance and jump to the code that belongs to its class.  Supporting optimizations like this one requires keeping track of a lot more details of the class base than a native executable, including recording the full class and interface hierarchy, details of which methods override other methods, all method bytecode etc.  In a native executable most of the details of class structure and bytecode can be ignored at run time."

At that point the JVM has to jump out of the compiled code into the interpreter and recompile the code to cater for a new execution profile that includes the previously cold path.  That requires keeping runtime info that allow a compiled stack frame to be replaced with one or more interpreter frames.  It also requires runtime extensible profile counters to be allocated and updated to track what has or has not been executed."
