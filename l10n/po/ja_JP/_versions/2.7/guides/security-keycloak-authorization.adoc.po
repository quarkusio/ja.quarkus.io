It provides a flexible and dynamic authorization capability based on Resource-Based Access Control.  In other words, instead of explicitly enforcing access based on some specific access control mechanism (e.g.: RBAC), you just check whether or not a request is allowed to access a resource based on its name, identifier or URI."
