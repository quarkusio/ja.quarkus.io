The only drawback is that the password will never be fetched again from Vault after the initial property loading.  This means that if the db password was changed while running, the application would have to be restarted after Vault has been updated with the new password.  This contrasts with the credentials provider approach, which fetches the password from Vault every time a connection creation is attempted."
