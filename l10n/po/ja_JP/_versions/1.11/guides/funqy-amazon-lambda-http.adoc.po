msgid "If you want to allow HTTP clients to invoke on your Funqy functions on AWS Lambda, Quarkus allows you to expose multiple Funqy functions through HTTP deployed as one AWS Lambda.  This approach does add overhead over the regular Funqy AWS Lambda integration and also requires you to use AWS API Gateway."

msgid "Follow the link:amazon-lambda-http[Amazon Lambda Http Guide].  It walks through using a variety of HTTP frameworks on Amazon Lambda, including Funqy."

#. type: Plain text

msgid "The Funqy HTTP + AWS Lambda binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because Funqy needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function providers its HTTP binding is very minimalistic and you will lose REST features like linking and the ability to leverage HTTP features like cache-control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's JAX-RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Route link:amazon-lambda-http[support] instead.  They also work with Quarkus and AWS Lambda."
