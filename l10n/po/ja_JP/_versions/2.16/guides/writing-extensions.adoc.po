msgid "Quarkus extensions add a new developer focused behavior to the core offering, and consist of two distinct parts, buildtime augmentation and runtime container. The augmentation part is responsible for all metadata processing, such as reading annotations, XML descriptors etc. The output of this augmentation phase is recorded bytecode which is responsible for directly instantiating the relevant runtime services."

msgid "Quarkus’s mission is to transform your entire application including the libraries it uses, into an artifact that uses significantly less resources than traditional approaches. These can then be used to build native applications using GraalVM.  To do this you need to analyze and understand the full \"closed world\" of the application.  Without the full and complete context, the best that can be achieved is partial and limited generic support.  By using the Quarkus extension approach, we can bring Java applications in line with memory footprint constrained environments like Kubernetes or cloud platforms."

The most useful configuration options should be exposed as `quarkus.[extension].` instead of the natural namespace of the library.  Less common properties can live in the library namespace."

The output of these build steps is some recorded bytecode, using an extension of the ObjectWeb ASM project called Gizmo(ext/gizmo), that is used to actually bootstrap the application at runtime. Depending on the `io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.ExecutionTime` value of the `@io.quarkus.deployment.annotations.Record` annotation associated with the build step, the step may be run in a different JVM based on the following two modes."

This means that if a framework can boot in this phase then it will have its booted state directly written to the image, and so the boot code does not need to be executed when the image is started."

This extension allows for Arquillian-style tests that test specific functionalities.  It is not intended for testing user applications, as this should be done via `io.quarkus.test.junit.QuarkusTest`.  The main difference is that `QuarkusTest` simply boots the application once at the start of the run, while `QuarkusUnitTest` deploys a custom Quarkus application for each test class."
