msgid "The Quarkus LRA extension is useful for building JAX-RS services that wish to definitively agree when an interaction has finished, with either a successful outcome or an unsuccessful one.  In the successful case, all participants can clean up in the knowledge that all other services will do so as well. Conversely, in the unsuccessful case, participants know that each other will compensate for any actions performed during the interaction. This feature means that participating services can reach a consensus and achieve an atomic outcome."

#: upstream/_posts/2021-09-01-using-lra.adoc:16
msgid "We call the service interaction an LRA, short for Long Running Action. An LRA has specific properties and guarantees that aid in the construction of reliable service interactions. Each action is assigned a unique identifier (referred to as the LRA context) so that it can be distinguished from other LRAs."

msgid "Services start an LRA (or join an existing one) by marking a JAX-RS method with an https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/ws/rs/LRA.html[@LRA annotation]. When such a method is invoked the system will start the action and make its identifier available as a JAX-RS header called \"Long-Running-Action\". If the body of the method performs any JAX-RS invocations the header is automatically added to outgoing requests. In this way the target services can join in with the interaction (if they are also annotated with the `@LRA` annotation)."

msgid "Any work performed by a method annotated in this way should be \"compensatable\" in the sense that if some service \"cancels\" the LRA then the service will be reliably notified that it should compensate for any work that it did. Each service is responsible for interpreting the notion of what it means to compensate, the only requirement is that it responds https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/ParticipantStatus.html[appropriately] when it is notified that it should compensate. The service indicates how it should be notified by annotating one of its method with an https://download.eclipse.org/microprofile/microprofile-lra-1.0/apidocs/org/eclipse/microprofile/lra/annotation/Compensate.html[@Compensate] annotation. Refer to the javadoc for the `@LRA` annotation for the details of how to control the outcome of an LRA."

This component must be present when starting the interaction, when joining the interaction and when ending the interaction. If the coordinator becomes unavailable it should be restarted. Similarly, services participating in the LRA must be available during the end phase; the system will continue retrying a service until it indicates that it is finished with the LRA, and once a service has indicated successful compensation (or completion) it no longer takes part in the interaction (although it can register for a reliable notification that all services have finished compensating or completing). Although there can be many coordinators, at the time of writing, only one can manage a particular LRA."
