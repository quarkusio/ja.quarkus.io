"At its core, Quarkus is built on Eclipse Vert.x, a high-performance reactive toolkit.\n"
"Still, it allows developers to work primarily in an imperative style while leveraging the performance benefits of its reactive underpinnings.\n"
"This hybrid approach allows developers to squeeze out even more efficiency from traditional imperative programming while offering the flexibility to adopt reactive patterns where they make sense.\n"
"Unlike traditional reactive-only frameworks, Quarkus enables developers to combine both imperative and reactive styles in a single application.\n"
"This is particularly beneficial for systems requiring high throughput and low latency, ensuring that applications remain robust under heavy load.\n"
"Quarkus's reactive model makes it ideal for event-driven architectures and microservices."
