As well as How to use Camel extensions for Quarkus to build powerful Java Integrations. There is a cool short step-by-step guide to create a new microservice in \"Reactive Timer Microservice with Java Quartz, DynamoDB and Quarkus\". Get the baseline knowledge and understanding Reactive Messaging with Apache Kafka with \"Getting Started to Quarkus Reactive Messaging with Apache Kafka\". \"Process Formula 1 telemetry with Quarkus and OpenShift Streams for Apache Kafka\" is a great article showing how race team engineers can exploit multiple software technologies to process telemetry data in a Java application in real time. Follow up with \"3 Reasons Why All Java Developers Should Consider Quarkus\"."
