msgid "Although focused on microservices, Quarkus is also perfectly suited for large monoliths, whether you are migrating existing applications to a more modern runtime or building new ones from scratch. Quarkus has always been able to handle large applications, but we have recently made significant improvements in this area, particularly when it comes to build times. Read \"Towards faster builds\" by Guillaume Smet to learn more about these improvements. Read \"Implementing an arXiv MCP Server with Quarkus in Java\" by Guillaume Laforge to learn about building an MCP server to access the arXiv research paper website where pre-print versions are published and shared with the community. The author's goal was to shed light on some lesser-known aspects of the Model Context Protocol, tools, resources and prompts. Learn the details of why Anand Jaisy chose to switch frameworks in \"Micronaut vs Quarkus: Why I Switched After Two Years\". Check out \"How to Trace Quarkus Reactive Messaging with OpenTelemetry\" by Nawaz Dhandala to learn how to implement distributed tracing for Quarkus Reactive Messaging applications using OpenTelemetry to track messages across Kafka and other messaging systems. Make sure you try this realistic Java walkthrough showing validation, retries, idempotency, and Kafka-backed workflows with Quarkus in \"Your Second Reactive Messaging App: What Production Systems Actually Need\" by Markus Eisele. Then you can learn about using graph-based analysis to detect and prevent architectural decay in Java applications in his second blog post, \"Your Quarkus Architecture Is Drifting. JQAssistant Can Prove It.\""
