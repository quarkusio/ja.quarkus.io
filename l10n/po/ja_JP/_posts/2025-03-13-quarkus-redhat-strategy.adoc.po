IBM and Red Hat have clearly communicated that the current and future contributions to Quarkus are a key component of the middleware strategy. IBM has already been an active contributor to Quarkus, and we look forward to increased contribution - alongside the many other individuals and companies who contribute, innovate, and drive Quarkus forward."

msgid "Additionally, *Quarkus is already on the path to becoming part of https://www.commonhaus.org/[Commonhaus] an open-source foundation*, further ensuring its long-term independence and success as a truly community-driven project. The move to the foundation and the Red Hat/IBM move could look suspicious timing-wise, but the two are unrelated. We described our reasons in a https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/[previous blog post], but if anything, this announcement reaffirms the importance of a foundation-hosted project for its stability."
