This was a collaboration between our WildFly and Quarkus teams at Red Hat and Google. Today, we have released A2A Java SDK 0.2.3.Beta1, which aligns with the v0.2.3 version of the https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A/tree/v0.2.3[A2A specification]. In this blog post, we'll cover how to easily get started with Quarkus and A2A using the A2A Java SDK."

It enables AI agents to communicate and collaborate with one another, regardless of each agent's underlying framework, language, or vendor. This is important, as it paves the way for polyglot multi-agent systems."
