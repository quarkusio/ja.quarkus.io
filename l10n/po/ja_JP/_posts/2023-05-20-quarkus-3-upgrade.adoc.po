msgid "Nevertheless, there is also some tedious work that needs to be done.  Quarkus 3 has updated to the latest Jakarta EE 10 APIs, which include the infamous change of the `javax.\\*` to the `jakarta.*` packages.  If your application makes use of any Jakarta API, and there's a good chance it does (think about JAX-RS, CDI, JPA, etc.), you'll need to modify your code.  Furthermore, if there's an explicit Jakarta API dependency in the project, you'll need to update this dependency as well."
