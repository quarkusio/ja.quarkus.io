"This blog post takes a deep dive into the evolution of SmallRye Stork beyond its initial release, providing a detailed exploration of its fresh additions.\n"
"But first, let's describe briefly what Stork can do for you.\n"
"SmallRye Stork is a client-side service discovery and selection framework.\n"
"It provides out-of-the-box integrations with Kubernetes, Eureka, and Hashicorp Consul, as well as a set of selection strategies, including round-robin, power-of-two-choices and best response time.\n"
"But the most noteworthy feature of Stork is its extensibility. You can create your own service selection strategy or plug in your own service discovery mechanism.\n"
"If you don't know it yet, a good way to get started is to take a look at our https://quarkus.io/guides/stork[getting started guide]."

"Additionally, our documentation has also been enhanced, offering comprehensive guides for both seasoned users and those taking their first steps with Stork.\n"
"To further support your exploration, there is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCNwxPDGt7Q[a video] and supplementary content that show Stork's capabilities in detail, don’t hesitate to check them out.\n"
"Don't have much time? Don't worry, we have the https://www.youtube.com/shorts/F4Gd1I1zfjs[perfect video] to understand Stork in less than 1 minute."

msgid "Programmatic service definition"
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid "Initially, you had to configure Stork in the application configuration. You needed to configure the service discovery and selection (optionally) for each _service_ you wanted to discover and select."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"Stork, from the 1.2.0 version, proposes a programmatic API to allow users to define the service discovery and selection configuration through code rather\n"
"than through declarative or external configuration files. This means that you can use the full expressive power of Java to explicitly specify new service\n"
"definitions and do manual lookup and selection. This is particularly beneficial when the configuration requirements of an application are not known until runtime,\n"
"and it provides the ability to adjust settings without restarting the application."
msgstr ""

msgid "When using the programmatic API of Stork, you can:"

msgid "The second noticeable improvement is the integration with CDI."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"Users may prefer using a framework that leverages CDI mechanism to easily manage and inject dependencies and have a more testable and maintainable code.\n"
"Stork can now do that. Starting from the 2.0.1 release, users can use the service discovery and load balancer as beans.\n"
"For that, it looks for CDI beans during the initialization in addition to the SPI providers.\n"
"It is worth mentioning that this enhancement also contributes to improving the Quarkus experience."

msgid "We are happy to announce a few added service discovery strategies using DNS and Knative."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid "With the Knative service discovery, Smallrye Stork introduces seamless service discovery through its serverless infrastructure, even when there are no 'pod' running."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid "The Stork Knative service discovery implementation is very similar to the Kubernetes one."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"Stork will ask for https://knative.dev/docs/serving/reference/serving-api/#serving.knative.dev/v1.Service[Knative services] to the cluster instead of vanilla https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#service-resource[Kubernetes services] used by the Kubernetes implementation.\n"
"Again, to do so, Stork uses https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client/blob/master/extensions/knative/client/src/main/java/io/fabric8/knative/client/KnativeClient.java[Fabric 8 Knative Client] which is just an extension of Fabric8 Kubernetes Client."

"The DNS-based service discovery is also here to stay. When a service has registered one or more instances in a Domain Name System (DNS) server,\n"
"Stork will be able to discover them by querying the DNS. This strategy is simple and widely used, so Stork could not fail to implement it."

msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"The sticky service selection implemented by Stork refers to a strategy where a client \"sticks\" to a particular instance of a service until it fails,\n"
"then it selects another one. It is also possible to configure a backoff period for specifying how long a failing service instance should be retried.\n"
"This can be useful in scenarios where maintaining a consistent connection to the same instance is beneficial, such as when dealing with sessions or\n"
"stateful applications."

msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"This enhancement was driven by the specific requirements of Kubernetes service discovery as contacting the cluster too frequently can result in performance\n"
"problems. So, out of the box, Stork Kubernetes service discovery now comes with a tailored cache expiration strategy to keep service instances until an event occurs."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2023-11-23-stork-latest-news.adoc
msgid ""
"If you would like to do so for your custom service discovery implementations, you need:\n"
"- Extend the CachingServiceDiscovery as mentioned above.\n"
"- Implement the `cache` method where the expiration strategy is defined.\n"
"- Invalidate the cache when the expiration condition evaluates to `true`."
