"During the development of Quarkus 2.13,\n"
"we discovered that there was a startup degradation in native mode.\n"
"One of the key aspects of this degradation was that RSS consumption on start up had gone up by about 10-15% compared to Quarkus 2.7.\n"
"In this blog post you will learn how the Quarkus native RSS consumption debugging techniques described in\n"
"https://quarkus.io/guides/native-reference#rss[the Quarkus native reference guide]\n"

"Since Quarkus 2.7 and 2.13 used different GraalVM versions (21.3 vs 22.3),\n"
"we first investigated whether the increase in the startup time and RSS consumption was due to a change in GraalVM.\n"
"This turned out to not be the case,\n"

"In native mode we needed to look for system calls that increased RSS,\n"

"There are several system calls that can be used to allocate memory, e.g. `malloc`, `mmap`...etc,\n"
"but when we analysed the system calls emitted on startup,\n"
"we discovered that `mmap` calls were the prominent ones.\n"

"`mmap` calls happen for a variety of reasons,\n"
"but in the context of this blog post,\n"
"we're interested in those `mmap` calls that are triggered by object allocations.\n"
"Not every object allocation triggers an `mmap` call.\n"
"Instead, each thread in SubstrateVM will allocate a heap chunk using `mmap` when the first object is allocated,\n"
"and it will use this heap chunk as long as there's space for further objects allocated in the same thread.\n"
"When the heap chunk is full,\n"
"the thread will request a new heap chunk using `mmap`.\n"
"This pattern is called thread-local allocation.\n"
"HotSpot has a similar feature as well,\n"
"but there the heap chunk size is dynamically computed depending on multiple factors,\n"
"while on SubstrateVM the size is fixed.\n"
"At the time of writing, the default heap chunk size is 1MB,\n"
"but an upcoming change will make it 512KB instead."

"We describe the object allocation as fast when the thread has a heap chunk cached and there's enough space for the object.\n"
"We describe the object allocation as slow when the thread needs to request a new heap chunk via the `mmap` system call to satisfy the object allocation.\n"
"Slow allocations are the most interesting in this case,\n"
"because they give us a rough indication of which allocations are pushing the number of heap chunks up,\n"
"and therefore are pushing the RSS consumption up.\n"
"In SubstrateVM, stacktraces of the slow allocation path contain invocations to methods defined in the `com.oracle.svm.core.genscavenge.ThreadLocalAllocation` class that contain the `slowPathNew` prefix in their name .\n"

"which are executed by the `main` thread.\n"

"and then click on `Search` at the top right and type `slowPathNew`,\n"
