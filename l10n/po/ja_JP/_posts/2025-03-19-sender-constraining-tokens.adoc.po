msgid "Implementing the cryptographic binding is not complex in this case. The current access token is expected to contain a confirmation with the SHA-256 certificate thumbprint and it must match the thumbprint of the current MTLS client certificate. If the token is in JWT format, then it must include a confirmation claim. If the token is binary then the confirmation must be included in the remote token introspection response."
