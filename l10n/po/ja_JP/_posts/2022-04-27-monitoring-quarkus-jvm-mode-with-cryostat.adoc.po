msgid "Quarkus famously has the ability to be built in standard JVM mode (the build produces .JAR files to be loaded and run by the JVM at runtime) or native mode (the build produces a native binary to be directly executed). Cryostat relies upon both JDK Flight Recorder (JFR), which is only partially supported in Quarkus native mode, and JDK Management Extensions (JMX), which is not supported in native mode at the time of writing. This means that, unfortunately, only JVM-mode Quarkus applications can be configured for use with Cryostat."
