#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2021-11-23-smallrye-stork-intro.adoc:16
msgid "Nowadays, systems we build consist of numerous applications, often called microservices. The system's overall behavior emerges from the interactions between all these services. So, a microservice is likely going to invoke other ones. But here is the catch. In dynamic environments, such as Kubernetes, or the Cloud, the locations of these services may change over time. So, how does our microservice locate the services it needs to call?"

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2021-11-23-smallrye-stork-intro.adoc:18
msgid "Service discovery solves that problem, as it provides a mechanism to register and find the services. But it leads to another issue. What happens when there are multiple instances of the same service? How does a microservice select the right one? This scenario typically occurs when there are multiple replicas or versions available at the same time. Thus, in addition to service discovery, we need a way to select the right one."

msgid "Some environments, e.g., Kubernetes, provide ways to discover service locations and load-balance the traffic. Some do not. In some cases, the capabilities of the environment are not sufficient for the needs of the system."

#: upstream/_posts/2021-11-23-smallrye-stork-intro.adoc:32
msgid "Out of the box, it provides integrations with Hashicorp Consul, Eureka, and Kubernetes and brings in a couple of load-balancer (handling the service selection) implementations, such as round-robin. But the most significant strength of Stork is its extensibility. You can plug your own service discovery mechanism or implement your own, maybe business-related, service selection strategy."
