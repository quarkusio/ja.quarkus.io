If you enable testing, your test suite will be run once at the start, and then continuous testing will run your tests as you are coding, and tell you if your changes will break any tests. This will give you instant feedback on your changes, without having to switch to a browser. As much as possible we only run tests that are relevant to the code that has been changed."
