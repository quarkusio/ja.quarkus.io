"  > Software can compensate for the performance effects of the workaround for this erratum with optimizations that align the code such that jump instructions (and macro-fused jump instructions) do not cross 32-byte boundaries or end on a 32-byte boundary.\n"
"  > Such aligning can reduce or eliminate the performance penalty caused by the transition of execution from Decoded ICache to the legacy decode pipeline.\n"

"While these changes do contribute to the increase in native executable size, they also come with performance and correctness benefits.\n"
"Therefore, the larger executables are a trade-off to ensure better application performance and avoid undesired side effects.\n"
