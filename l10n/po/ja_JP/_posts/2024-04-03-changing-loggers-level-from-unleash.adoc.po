"I'm part of a Red Hat team that is responsible for a dozen of Quarkus apps which run in Red Hat OpenShift, with multiple pods each.\n"
"While these apps all have different purposes, they also share a common fate: something will go wrong eventually.\n"
"When it does, we'll need to understand and fix the problem as fast as possible.\n"
"Lowering the level of a logger is often helpful, but our apps are containerized and updating an environment variable to change the logger level isn't always as easy at it sounds.\n"
"We also don't want to expose REST endpoints in most of our apps, so extensions such as https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-logging-manager[quarkus-logging-manager^] are not an option."
