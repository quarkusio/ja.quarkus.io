msgid "However, that's not because you use virtual threads that your application has no more concurrency limit.  There is a new bottleneck: the **database connection pool**.  When you interact with the database, you ask for a connection to the connection pool (Agroal in our case).  The number of connections is not infinite (20 by default).  Once all the connections are used, you must wait until another processing completes and releases its connection.  You can still handle many requests concurrently, but they will wait for database connections to be available, reducing the response time."
