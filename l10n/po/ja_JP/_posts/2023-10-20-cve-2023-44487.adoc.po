msgid "When you browse a website that supports HTTP/2, such as https://quarkus.io, it enables the use of a single connection to fetch numerous resources, including the index page, images, JavaScript scripts, fonts, CSS files, and more. This eliminates the need for the browser to repeatedly establish new connections for each resource, resulting in a more efficient and faster browsing experience. Furthermore, HTTP/2 doesn't require the browser to wait for a response before sending another request."

msgid "This streaming capability of HTTP/2 enhances application concurrency and minimizes network costs, as it reduces the need for numerous connections. Nevertheless, this feature can pose challenges, as a single connection can generate a multitude of requests. To address this, HTTP/2 offers a means of restraining the number of active concurrent streams to prevent clients from overburdening the server. This control is a server-side setting. When a client connects, the server communicates its maximum allowable concurrency. In Quarkus, the ceiling for concurrent streams is set at 100 by default. This limit can be customized using the `quarkus.http.limits.max-concurrent-streams` property."

msgid "But there's more to the story. In HTTP/2, both the client and server maintain stream status, eventually syncing. Unlike HTTP 1.1, HTTP/2 permits clients to gracefully cancel in-flight requests using the `RST_STREAM` frame. On the client side, the stream closes upon frame transmission, while the server-side closure happens upon processing. This cancellation doesn't impact other streams in the same connection."

msgid "The CVE-2023-44487 attack capitalizes on rapid stream cancellations. While the client closes streams, the server-side closure lags, effectively bypassing the client's stream limit. This allows the client to open an excessive number of streams, up to 1,073,741,824. During the attack, the client initiates a request via a `HEADERS` frame in a new stream and immediately dispatches the `RST_STREAM` frame. From the client's viewpoint, the stream closes. However, the server must allocate resources to process the `RST_STREAM` frame, ultimately closing the associated stream."

msgid "As the client repeatedly opens and cancels streams in quick succession, the server grapples with handling `RST_STREAM` frames and associated bookkeeping. The severity of the attack differs between server technologies. In a one-thread-per-request model, it can be catastrophic, as it consumes all available worker threads, leading to queued `HEADERS` and `RST_STREAM` frames and negatively impacting concurrent legitimate requests, thus significantly affecting service availability (CVE score: 7.3/10)."

msgid "In the case of Netty-based servers (like Quarkus) and other event loop-based servers, the issue is less severe. The incoming frames are placed in the event loop queue, causing higher CPU usage but no thread starvation. Also, Netty handles `RST_STREAM` frames very efficiently. This may result in higher response times, with the server appearing busy but still managing concurrent legitimate requests. While a problem, its impact on availability is relatively lower (CVE score: 5.3/10)."

The system monitors `RST_STREAM` frames sent per connection, imposing a 200-frame limit within a 30-second window. If the threshold is exceeded, Quarkus takes action by closing the connection and issuing a `GOAWAY` frame. This procedure closes the connection and all currently active streams associated with it."
