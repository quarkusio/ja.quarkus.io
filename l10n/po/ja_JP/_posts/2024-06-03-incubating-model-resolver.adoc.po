#: _posts/2024-06-03-incubating-model-resolver.adoc
msgid "Dependency resolution is typically one of the most time-consuming tasks during a build. Given that Quarkus has its specific https://quarkus.io/guides/writing-extensions#extension-philosophy[Quarkus Extension dependency model], it comes with its own Maven dependency resolver. The Quarkus dependency resolver is used in every build phase that requires application dependencies to be resolved, that includes building the final package, bootstraping applications in dev and test modes."

#: _posts/2024-06-03-incubating-model-resolver.adoc
msgid "From the perspective of the Quarkus dependency resolver, dependencies declared in POMs of Quarkus projects are runtime dependencies (except certain cases for `provided` scope). They are runtime in a sense they will end up on the runtime classpath of the final application (test runtime classpath in case of `test` dependencies). These original project dependencies serve as input to the Quarkus dependency resolver."
msgstr ""

#: _posts/2024-06-03-incubating-model-resolver.adoc
msgid "The job of the Quarkus dependency resolver is then to resolve the necessary Quarkus extension build time dependencies (those with the `-deployment` suffix and their dependencies) to create a complete Quarkus application build time dependency tree that will be used to initialize the build classpath of an application."

msgid "The original application dependencies will still be downloaded by Maven as usually, since Maven build process will most probably need them before Quarkus goals will run.

#: _posts/2024-06-03-incubating-model-resolver.adoc
msgid "It's not very precise since there are more Maven related operations involved than simply resolving Quarkus dependencies. Therefore calculating an average time of around 10 runs would be a way to capture the difference. Another alternative would be to run `mvn test -Dtest=SoSimpleTest`."

#: _posts/2024-06-03-incubating-model-resolver.adoc

"For a project such as Quarkus CLI, `quarkus:dependency-tree` appears to be ~100ms faster with the incubating model resolver (the new resolver takes ~25% less time to resolve dependencies from the local Maven repository).\n"
"Bootstrapping a similar application for a `QuarkusTest` will take ~125ms less time, however it will be only ~10% faster overall since resolving dependencies from a test process will not be able to benefit from the Maven resolver dependency cache used in the main Maven process (among other things)."
