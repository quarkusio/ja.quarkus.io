"MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context\n"

"(be it a set of static documents or dynamically accessed data, for example\n"
"from a database), or pre-defined prompts that your AI-infused application\n"
"can use when talking to LLMs. When you package such functionality into an\n"
"MCP server, it can be plugged into and used by any LLM client toolkit that\n"
"supports MCP, including Quarkus and LangChain4j. There is also already a\n"
