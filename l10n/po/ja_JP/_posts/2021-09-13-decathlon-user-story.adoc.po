msgid "The Value Chain IT department faces a major problem around data exposure and consumption to and from the other departments of DECATHLON.

The department’s reliance on legacy workflows and ERP ecosystems resulted in significant productivity bottlenecks.  Thinking about data as streams is a popular approach nowadays. In many cases, it allows to build a data engineering architecture in a more efficient way than the classic “data as a state” one. But to support the streaming data paradigm, we need to use additional technologies. One of the most popular tools for working with streaming data is Apache Kafka, and DECATHLON decided to invest heavily in it."

After a week of development with Quarkus, I was able to regain the same level of productivity as when I was developing with Spring Boot. For the implementation of our platform, SmallRye Reactive Messaging was newer to me and met the architectural constraints of our platform. Our POC was successful with results (simplicity, performance, resilience) above our expectations. Despite the positive results obtained, I did not want to stop there.

"We deployed on the cloud, which implies direct cost we can measure easily. Even if today our platform is not yet used a lot in production (only half of the currently deployed topics are really used), we foreseen a need to scale to up to 1.5 million messages per minute at the end of 2022, and to connect to more than twice the current number of ERP\n"

Oh, yes, and this is on Java 16 and using the JVM."
