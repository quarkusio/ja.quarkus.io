msgid "Abraxas is the largest provider of integrated IT solutions for the public sector in Switzerland. They made a strategic decision to create a new modular, cloud-native tax solution that could be used throughout Switzerland’s cantons and municipalities to implement tax laws. Each canton and municipality has different rules and requirements for taxing its citizens which posed a unique challenge for the team."

While the Polaris team is a part of a larger organization, it acts very much like a startup. This provided the team with the ability to identify and implement the best technology for the job in order to meet the needs of their customers."

The project includes PostgreSQL, Kafka and REST endpoints. New developers are typically up and running with the technology within 1-2 weeks which makes it easy to onboard new developers."
