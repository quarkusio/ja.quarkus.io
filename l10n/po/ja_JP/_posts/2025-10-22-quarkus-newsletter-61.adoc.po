msgid "See how BCE/ECB keeps Java applications clean, testable, and future-proof. With rules that fail the build when you break them in \"Guard Your Code: Enforcing Architecture Boundaries in Quarkus with ArchUnit\" by Markus Eisele. Elder Moraes's \"Building a Web-Searching Agent with Ollama, Langchain4j, and Quarkus\" is a great guide that provides a step-by-step, hands-on tutorial for Java developers to construct a sophisticated AI agent that embodies the new paradigm where the model can autonomously decide it needs more information and knows how to get it. A2A Java SDK 0.3.0.Alpha1 makes it possible to quickly get started with Quarkus and A2A using the latest, more stable version of the A2A protocol. Read \"Getting Started with Quarkus and A2A Java SDK 0.3.0\" by Farah Juma to learn more.
