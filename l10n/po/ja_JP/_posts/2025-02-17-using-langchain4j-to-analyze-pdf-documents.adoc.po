#: _posts/2025-02-17-using-langchain4j-to-analyze-pdf-documents.adoc
msgid "Our client receives compressed archives (.zip files) containing up to hundreds of portable document format (PDF) lease documents that need review. Each document contains property lease details that must be validated for accuracy. The review process involves checking various business rules - for example, identifying leases with terms shorter than 2 years. Currently, this document validation is done manually, which is time-consuming. The client wants to automate and streamline this review workflow to improve efficiency."

msgid "After consulting with https://github.com/dliubarskyi[Dmytro Liubarskyi] and collaborating with the Quarkus team, we implemented a solution using LangChain4j for document metadata extraction. We chose https://ai.google.dev/docs/gemini_api_overview[Google Gemini] as our Large Language Model (LLM) since it excels at PDF analysis through its built-in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capabilities, enabling accurate text extraction from both digital and scanned documents."
