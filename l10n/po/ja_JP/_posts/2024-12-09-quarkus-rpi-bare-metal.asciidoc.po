"Four years ago, Andrea Battaglia wrote an excellent https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-native-on-a-raspberry-pi/[blog post] about running a Quarkus application (that is compiled to a native executable) in a container on a Raspberry Pi.\n"
"This is an interesting use case but it’s not the only one.\n"
"Since Raspberry Pi is often used for home and science projects I was particularly interested in the developer experience when you want to develop your application locally on your laptop but run it on a bare metal Raspberry Pi server, i.e. no containers involved.\n"
"Raspberry Pi is not infrequently extended with various sensors and pheripherals.\n"
"And it's very practical to be able to communicate with these devices direcly, during development.\n"
"That's why we focused in this direction."
