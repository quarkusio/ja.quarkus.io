"While sending payloads is more straightforward, sometimes you want to attach metadata to the message, like configuring how it should be written in Kafka, tracing information, etc.\n"
"The emitter also allows sending messages, and so attach the metadata you want.\n"

"We set the key, the topic, and so on.\n"

"Passing the message immediately would violate the Reactive Streams protocol.\n"
"We must be sure that the downstream components are ready to accept this message.\n"
"As a result, the emitter is not pushing the message directly, but enqueue it in a buffer used to handle the downstream capacity (requests in Reactive Streams lingo)."

"But with buffer comes... overflow.\n"
"If you emit too many messages and the downstream cannot keep up, the messages are stored in the buffer until it reaches its maximum capacity.\n"
"Then, you cannot emit anymore, and attempting to emit will throw exceptions.\n"
"But what can we do in this case?\n"
"When injecting the emitter, you can configure an Overflow strategy.\n"
"For example, you can set the buffer size, use an unbounded buffer, drop the messages, fail, or just ignore the back pressure and let the downstream handle it.\n"
"By default, it uses a buffer, but depending on your use case, you may want to configure it differently:"
