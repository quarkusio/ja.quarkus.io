"Easy answer!\n"

"Retries may not be the solution to your problem, as it can be terrible.\n"
"Retrying can only be done if your system can handle duplicated requests or messages.\n"
"In other words, you can only retry if your system is idempotent, i.e., sending a request or a message multiple times does not change the overall state.\n"
