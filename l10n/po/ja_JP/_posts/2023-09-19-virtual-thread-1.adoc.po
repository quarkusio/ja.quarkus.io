msgid "At the beginning of the Java time, Java had _green threads_.  Green threads were user-level threads scheduled by the Java virtual machine (JVM) instead of natively by the underlying operating system (OS).  They emulated multithreaded environments without relying on native OS abilities.  They were managed in user space instead of kernel space, enabling them to work in environments that do not have native thread support.  Green threads were briefly available in Java between 1997 and 2000.  I used green threads; they did not leave me with a fantastic memory."

So, creating a platform thread creates an OS thread, and **blocking a platform thread blocks an OS thread**."

For example, when your application receives an HTTP request, the framework creates or reuses a platform thread (and so an OS thread) and executes the processing on that thread.  The whole processing runs on this thread, and the thread cannot be reused until the processing completes (so the response is sent back).  When the processing executes a blocking I/O operation, like calling another service, writing to the file system, or interacting with a database, the thread is blocked, waiting for the response.  As mentioned above, the OS thread is also blocked while waiting.  When this response is received, the processing continues:"

They consume memory (around 1 Mb per thread), are expensive to create, use CPU to schedule them… Frameworks use thread pools to allow reusing idle threads, but when the concurrency level exceeds your number of threads, you start pilling up requests, reducing the response time, and, in the worst case, even rejecting requests.  Increasing the thread pool size and, consequently, increasing the memory usage can blow up your Cloud bill and deployment density.  Futhermore, adding more threads may not even improve the concurrency as explained by the https://youtu.be/07V08SB1l8c?t=142[Little Law]."

It promotes the usage of non-blocking I/O and asynchronous development models to use resources (CPU and memory) more efficiently.  With the reactive model, **a single thread can handle multiple concurrent requests**.  So, instead of having a large pool of threads, you have a minimum number of threads (generally equal to the number of CPU cores).  This small amount of threads, often named event loops, handles all your requests.  When a request is received, it calls the processing code on one of these threads.  When the processing needs to execute an I/O operation, instead of using blocking I/O, it schedules the operations and passes a **continuation**.  This continuation is the code to be invoked when the I/O completes, so basically, the rest of the processing:"

While there are multiple approaches, such as callbacks, futures, reactive programming, or co-routines, it makes the code harder to reason about.  The code must be structured in a way that may not be natural for every developer.  That limits the adoption of this solution.  Also, the code can not only block during I/O operation; it must not execute lengthy processing (what we call monopolization).  The model's efficiency comes from the ability to process many requests concurrently.  If the thread is used for a long time, it does not allow the other requests to be processed, and, as for the imperative model, you start piling up requests."

When your code running on a virtual thread needs to execute an I/O operation, it uses a blocking API.  So, the code waits for the result, as with the imperative model.  However, since the JVM manages virtual threads, no underlying OS thread is blocked when they perform this blocking operation.  The state of the virtual thread is stored in the heap, and another virtual thread can be executed on the same Java platform (carrier) thread, exactly as in the reactive model.  When the I/O operation completes, the virtual thread becomes executable again, and when a carrier thread is available, the state of the virtual thread is restored, and the execution continues.  For the developer, this magic is invisible! You just write synchronous code, and it's executed like proper reactive code without blocking the OS thread."

These objects can only be accessed by the code running on the thread in which the objects are stored.  Because the number of threads was limited, it capped the number of creation.  Also, because threads were reused, the objects were cached and reused.  Unfortunately, these two assumptions are not valid with virtual threads: You can have a lot of them, they are not reused.

For example, database connections should not be accessed concurrently.  You must be cautious when you have many virtual threads, especially when using the structured concurrency API (still in preview in Java 21)."
