Instead of dictating usage, we now enable users to experiment easily with both Hibernate ORM and Reactive. Projects using Hibernate ORM can add the Reactive extension, create reactive resources reusing mapped entities, run tests and benchmarks, and determine if it suits their specific needs and scalability goals. While using both, it’s easier to choose the most suitable approach for different use cases. Another benefit is that it makes it easier to migrate in small steps from one to the other as necessary."
