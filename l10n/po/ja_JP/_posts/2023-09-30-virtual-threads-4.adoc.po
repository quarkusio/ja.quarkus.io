"The processing of each message runs on separate virtual threads.\n"

"This execution model can be used with any Quarkus reactive messaging connector, including AMQP 1.0, Apache Pulsar, and Apache Kafka.\n"
"The concurrency of this processing is no longer limited by the number of worker threads, as it would with the `@Blocking` annotation.\n"

"As we will see later, such high-level concurrency can cause problems.\n"
"To keep this concurrency controllable, Quarkus limits the number of concurrent message processing to `1024` (This default value is https://quarkus.io/guides/messaging-virtual-threads[configurable]).\n"
"One of the main benefits of this limit is preventing the application from polling millions of messages, which would be very expensive in terms of memory.\n"
"Without this limit, a Kafka application would poll all the records from the assigned topics-partitions and consume a large amount of memory."

"To illustrate how to process Kafka records on virtual threads, let's consider a simple application.\n"
"This application is a fake fraud detector.\n"
"It analyzes banking transactions, and if the transaction amount for a given account in a given period of time reaches a threshold, we consider there is fraud.\n"
"The code is available in this https://github.com/quarkusio/virtual-threads-demos/tree/main/kafka-example[GitHub repository].\n"
"Of course, you can use more complex detection algorithms, and even use AI/ML.\n"
"In this case, we use the https://redis.io/docs/data-types/timeseries/[Redis time series] commands inefficiently to introduce more I/O than necessary.\n"

"But pinning is not the only problem that can arise.\n"
"While virtual threads can be appealing, you must be careful not to monopolize the carrier thread.\n"
"If, for example, you implemented a complex and CPU-intensive detection algorithm instead of relying on Redis, you would likely monopolize the carrier thread, defeating the purpose of virtual threads.\n"
"It will force the JVM to create new carrier threads, ultimately increasing memory usage.\n"
"The JVM will limit the number of created carrier threads.\n"
"When this happens, your application will under-perform as your tasks will be enqueued until a carrier thread is available."
