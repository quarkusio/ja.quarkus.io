In this post, we will see how you can process Kafka records on virtual threads, increasing the concurrency of the processing."

msgid "This execution model can be used with any Quarkus reactive messaging connector, including AMQP 1.0, Apache Pulsar, and Apache Kafka.  The concurrency of this processing is no longer limited by the number of worker threads, as it would with the `@Blocking` annotation.  Thus, this novel execution model simplifies the development of highly concurrent data streaming applications."

msgid "As we will see later, such high-level concurrency can cause problems.  To keep this concurrency controllable, Quarkus limits the number of concurrent message processing to `1024` (This default value is https://quarkus.io/guides/messaging-virtual-threads[configurable]).  One of the main benefits of this limit is preventing the application from polling millions of messages, which would be very expensive in terms of memory.  Without this limit, a Kafka application would poll all the records from the assigned topics-partitions and consume a large amount of memory."

There are limitations that can make virtual threads dangerous.  You need to make sure your virtual threads usage is safe before using it.  We will see a few examples in this post."

msgid "To illustrate how to process Kafka records on virtual threads, let's consider a simple application.  This application is a fake fraud detector.  It analyzes banking transactions, and if the transaction amount for a given account in a given period of time reaches a threshold, we consider there is fraud.  The code is available in this https://github.com/quarkusio/virtual-threads-demos/tree/main/kafka-example[GitHub repository].  Of course, you can use more complex detection algorithms, and even use AI/ML.  In this case, we use the https://redis.io/docs/data-types/timeseries/[Redis time series] commands inefficiently to introduce more I/O than necessary.  It is done purposefully to utilize the virtual thread's ability to block:"
