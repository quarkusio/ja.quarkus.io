Quarkus is optimized for low memory usage and fast startup times.

With today's http://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-accelerate-your-lambda-functions-with-lambda-snapstart[announcement], the SnapStart feature is now an additional option to build and deploy functions written with Quarkus to AWS Lambda."

msgid "Typically AWS Lambda creates a new execution environment when invoking a new function for the first time or when it is scaled up to handle the traffic. SnapStart takes a different approach by taking a snapshot of the execution environment(memory and application state)  of the initialized function execution environment. Furthermore, it persists the snapshot and caches it for low-latency access. When invoking the function, it does not need to spend time initializing code, dependencies, or framework. Instead, Lambda resumes the new execution environment from the persisted snapshot."

"*Resource connections over the network***:** Snapshots do not guarantee connections back to remote hosts when a function is resumed. Developers will need to ensure and validate the state of connections.  +\n"
"*Pulling in-memory data from sources*: Often, one needs to pull data from a different source into memory. This can also lead to inconsistency if the data at the source has changed or even expired. Ensure and verify the state of such data. +\n"
"*Randomness*: Lambda SnapStart speeds up applications by re-using a single initialized snapshot many times over to resume execution environments. As a result, unique content which was included in the snapshot during initialization may be reused across execution environments and so may no longer remain unique. Ensure that unique content is generated after initialization, and avoid caching unique content during initialization. Refer to the feature documentation to understand these considerations around uniqueness and interfaces available to customers to restore uniqueness.\n"

msgid "A typical Java application uses JIT (Just in time) compilation. When an application starts up, it needs time for specific warm-up code paths to perform better, which means additional CPU cycles for warm-up times. Cloud-native applications demand a faster startup time. Ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation enables that by doing most of the optimizations at build time. A good example here is Quarkus. As a result, we have full speed from startup and no CPU overhead for compilations at startup time. Quarkus application initialization has two phases: static initialization and runtime initialization. This distinction follows the principles of the GraalVM native compilation, inlining the static initialization in the resulting executable, while the runtime initialization happens during the regular execution. We compared multiple functions to understand the benefits of each feature we added:"
