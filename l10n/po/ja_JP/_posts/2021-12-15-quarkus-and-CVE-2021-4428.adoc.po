msgid "As many of you have heard, the Java community has been rocked by a widespread vulnerability in the Apache Log4J 2 logging library. You can find more details about this vulnerability in https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-44228[CVE-2021-4428]"

msgid "Since Quarkus, its extensions, and dependencies do not use the log4j version 2 core library, it is *NOT susceptible* to this vulnerability. In most cases, no corrective action is required for any Quarkus backed projects you may have. Quarkus does expose the log4j API jar which in itself is not vulnerable. This is purely a compatibility and translation layer, which maps calls to a different logging backend (JBoss Logging). Therefore, any direct usage of the log4j API is not impacted."

msgid "You will find mention in https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-44228[Red Hat’s product security bulletin] that “Red Hat Integration Camel Extensions for Quarkus” is affected. It gets classified this way because during Red Hat’s productized build the log4j-core.jar got included in the generated Maven repository zip file due to the transitive nature of Maven dependencies. Meaning that if you use Camel Quarkus you are not affected by the log4j vulnerability but Red Hat product technically “shipped” the log4j-core.jar thus it is marked as affected."

msgid "As an added precaution, we do recommend auditing your application dependencies and/or setting the `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` system property to `true`. The latter will prevent any unintentional inclusion of this vulnerability. A simple way to do this is to add `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` to the Quarkus command line."
