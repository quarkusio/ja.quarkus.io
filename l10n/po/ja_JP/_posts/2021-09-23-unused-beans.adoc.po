msgid "Quarkus is a build-time oriented stack, i.e. it tries to do as much as possible at build time to improve the startup time and memory usage of your application.  However, it's not always so easy and straightforward as many existing frameworks and libraries do not take this design choice into account.  And CDI is one of them."

msgid "A traditional CDI container attempts to find all beans during the application bootstrap.  For each bean a metadata object is created and kept for the lifetime of the application.  This allows for certain degree of dynamicity at runtime but it's suboptimal when it comes to memory consumption and application startup time.  Quarkus, on the other hand, attempts to detect and remove all _unused_ beans, interceptors and decorators during build by default.  And the reason is simple.  This optimization helps to minimize the amount of generated classes and the number of metadata objects used at runtime, thus conserving memory."

msgid "Speaking of generated classes.  The bean discovery, validation and wiring all components together - all this is perfomed at build time.  Quarkus then stores the collected metadata in the bytecode, i.e. for each bean one or more classes are generated.  In order to fullfill some basic CDI API requirements, a bean has at least a corresponding `javax.enterprise.inject.spi.Bean` implementation.  If it's a normal scoped bean then a client proxy class must be also generated.  Finally, intercepted and decorated beans require some more internal constructs."

msgid "Imagine that your application contains 50 beans that are actually not used anywhere.  If they have a normal scope (e.g. `@ApplicationScoped`) and are intercepted (e.g. declare a method annotated with `@Transactional`) you can expect more than 150 generated classes.  And these classes are completely useless.  Still, the container would have to instantiate and hold a reference on those 50+ bean metadata classes.  Needless to say, that the bean classes and any referenced classes cannot be a subject to dead code elimination when a native image is generated.  Therefore, Quarkus implements an algorithm to get rid of all these classes."

msgid "But there's one problem.  Quarkus can't detect the programmatic lookup performed via the `CDI.current()` static method.  Therefore, it is possible that a certain bean removal results in a false positive error, i.e. a bean is removed although it's actually used.  In such cases, you'll notice a big warning in the log.  Of course, users and extension authors have several options how to eliminate these errors.  For users, the easiest way is to add a special annotation: `@io.quarkus.arc.Unremovable` or use the `quarkus.arc.unremovable-types` config property.  Finally, it's also possible to disable this optimization via the `quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans=false` config property."
