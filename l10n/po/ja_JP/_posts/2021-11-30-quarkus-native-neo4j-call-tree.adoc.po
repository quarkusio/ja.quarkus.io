msgid "This blog post is the culmination of an idea that Sanne (Grinovero) floated to me during some lunch, back at a time when we, remote engineers, would occasionally meet face to face and have the opportunity to share ideas spontaneously.  I'm unsure if the lunch was in Neuchâtel or Barcelona, but essentially Sanne was diagnosing an issue and he struggled with GraalVM's native image analysis call tree text output.  He wondered whether that data could instead be formatted differently and imported into a graph database for easier inspection.  I'm happy to announce that the GraalVM and Mandrel 21.3.0 releases include improvements to address this particular issue."

msgid "Before 21.3.0, when Quarkus instructed a GraalVM distribution to print out the call tree, the resulting output would be a single text file representing the call tree in a https://www.graalvm.org/reference-manual/native-image/Reports[custom tree format].  This text file would contain a lot of duplicated information and could be as big as several gigabytes in size."

msgid "GraalVM 21.3.0 introduces the possibility of representing call trees as CSV files instead of a single text file.  These CSV files contain method information and different connections between them (e.g. direct calls, virtual calls, overrides, etc).  One immediate benefit is that there's no information duplication, so the CSV files can be several times smaller in size compared to the corresponding text file.  In some situations, they can be as much as several thousands times smaller.  However, the main reason why this feature was implemented was to make it easier to feed the call tree to other tools, like graph databases such as https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j].  Once imported, a user can execute graph queries over the call tree, which makes it easier to extract relevant information and answer questions like the one above."
