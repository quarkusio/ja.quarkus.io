msgid "https://datacater.io[DataCater^] is a real-time, cloud-native data pipeline platform based on Apache Kafka and Kubernetes. It allows users to build streaming data pipelines that stream records between different Apache Kafka topics and can apply filters or transforms to the records on the way.  Given its focus on data scientists and data engineers as target users, DataCater enables users to develop transforms in Python. It provides an https://www.loom.com/share/15947f13e71540948e3f9d57eac64976[interactive, UI-based preview of streaming data pipelines^] and uses Kubernetes as the runtime for pipeline deployments."
