msgid "Developers who use Windows workstations might face the challenge of running Linux-native workflows.  One way to achieve this is by using Podman, a container engine that provides a command line capability to run Linux containers. Podman supports running containers both as \"rootful\" and as \"rootless\", with the latter being the default that doesn't require elevated privileges. In this blog post, we'll explore how to use Podman with Quarkus Native to build and run applications on Windows."
