"Starting with GraalVM for JDK 21,\n"

"Note: The heap of GraalVM Native Image executables has both read-only and read-write segments.\n"
"The read-only part is referred to as the \"image heap\" and contains the data pre-initialized during the image build to help speed up start-up time.\n"
"The read-write part is where allocations at runtime are made.\n"
"Therefore, heap dumps generated at runtime will contain content from both the \"image heap\" and the read-write heap."

"To see this flag in action, we need to manufacture a situation where a Quarkus application runs out of memory.\n"
"One easy way to achieve this is to configure the application with a garbage collector that doesn't do any memory reclamation,\n"
"i.e. the Epsilon GC.\n"
"Once the Quarkus application is running with Epsilon GC,\n"
"apply some load and within a short space of time it will run out of memory and produce a heap dump."
