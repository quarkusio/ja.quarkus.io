"The graph looked suspicious.\n"
"At a first glance, small garbage collections were happening regularly but those collections were not able to fully collect all the garbage.\n"

"why is there a relationship between the minimum heap size and the memory consumption at which a full GC appears to happen?\n"
"Looking at the output above,\n"
"on our system the default maximum heap size is 25.6GB.\n"
"GraalVM defaults the maximum heap size to 80% of the physical memory if no specific configuration is passed, and indeed 25.6GB is 80% of 32GB.\n"
"It would seem odd to do a full GC when 512MB have been consumed,\n"
"given that our system has given it a maximum heap size that is far bigger.\n"

"At this point we thought,\n"

"consumed close to 50% less heap compared to the \"by space and time\" one.\n"
"Note, however, that these graphs alone are not enough to make the switch since we could have a situation where \"adaptive\" is using less memory because the overall throughput is less.\n"
