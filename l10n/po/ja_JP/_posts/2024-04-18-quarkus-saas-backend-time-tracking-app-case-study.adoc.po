"We needed to create a time tracking application because the existing solutions on the market did not meet our specific requirements.\n"
"They were either not designed for developers, lacked the simplicity we needed, or were loaded with unnecessary features.\n"
"We wanted to build a tool that was perfectly tailored to our needs, using the extensive experience we had gained from working on client projects over the years.\n"
"We also wanted to create a more modern and user-friendly design, which would be fun to use and incorporate newer technologies such as Quarkus."

"The main issue we faced with existing time tracking solutions was the lack of an easy way to switch between clients.\n"
"We also found that they did not support quick actions or shortcuts, which we were used to, and there was no visual way to see the time entries we made during the day.\n"
"Additionally, we wanted to track time within the context of contracts signed with our clients in terms of daily rates and contract caps.\n"
"That's why we decided to create a custom solution to address all of these specific needs."

"We have designed our application architecture to separate the frontend and backend parts.\n"
"To secure our backend APIs in a modern and secure way, we opted to use JSON web tokens, and Quarkus has excellent support for them.\n"
"We also use role-based security for our APIs, and Quarkus makes it easy for us to implement this.\n"
"We have different roles in our application, such as regular users and admins, and this information is encoded in our JSON web tokens.\n"
"Quarkus ensures that these tokens are not tampered with or manipulated when they reach our back-end systems."

"We relied heavily on rich JSON support to model our data flexibly and delegate much of the functionality to Postgres itself to manipulate the data.\n"
"This way, we could pass the already-built JSON objects back to the API client, which significantly reduced the time it took to make design decisions in the application code.\n"
"Quarkus provided fantastic support for JSON object APIs.\n"
"We believe that Postgres is the right place to perform data manipulations and aggregations, not the application code, due to performance and code maintenance reasons."

"Although Quarkus primarily targets Java programming language, Kotlin support is also quite good.\n"
"We used coroutines and suspending functions, which allowed for greater performance and much simpler code compared to some other asynchronous programming models that are available.\n"
"Kotlin's structured concurrency enabled us to write seemingly sequential code but in reality, very performant asynchronous code.\n"
"Quarkus provides excellent Kotlin extension methods built on top of existing asynchronous APIs such as Mutiny."

"For our deployments, we use Kubernetes.\n"
"Before using Quarkus, we described our application requirements using helm packaging, but with Quarkus, we opted for another approach as Quarkus offers a great Kubernetes extension.\n"
"Instead of writing any code, we described our Kubernetes resources using an `application.yaml` file, keeping our complete application configuration in one place.\n"
"This extension generated Kubernetes resource files behind the scenes, which we then applied to our Kubernetes cluster.\n"
"This works well for us."

"The Quarkus development process has been excellent so far.\n"
"Compared to other frameworks like Spring Boot, Quarkus has a faster startup time and a smaller memory footprint.\n"
"It also provides profiles, which allows us to have slightly different configurations or behaviors between environments.\n"
"We can easily substitute some hard-to-run third-party services with local mocks, leaving the application code unchanged.\n"
"Quarkus is also great in terms of configuration and how easily we can overwrite values stored in the `application.yaml` file with external environment variables.\n"
"Although the hot reload mode didn't work well with Kotlin, I believe all the bugs related to it will be solved in upcoming releases.\n"
"During development, we had to restart our running service most of the time for code changes to take effect."

"Our backend API functionalities took approximately a month and a half to complete.\n"
"Considering that only two developers worked on the backend, I think it was a good result.\n"
"In this phase of our product lifecycle, we decided against writing automated tests due to constantly revisiting requirements and our needs.\n"
"Instead, we went for manual testing for now.\n"
"Once our time tracking application gets more active users, we plan to start writing automated tests using Quarkus test support, including Testcontainers and others.\n"
"Developing a full-blown API, including API security with JSON web tokens and authorization in place, having database migration automatically applied during application boot time, having a flexible and maintainable code base revolving around JSON, with the ability to package and deploy our API to our Kubernetes cluster, is quite an achievement for just a month and a half of work."
