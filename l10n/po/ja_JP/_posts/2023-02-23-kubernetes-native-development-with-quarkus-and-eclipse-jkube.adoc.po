They typically communicate with other services, such as databases, message brokers, or other microservices. Because of this distributed nature, developers often struggle to develop (and test!) individual microservices that are part of a larger system."

This new feature is centered around Kubernetes, allowing developers the ability to run and debug Java applications from a local machine while connected to a Kubernetes cluster. It is logically similar to placing a local development machine inside a Kubernetes cluster. Requests from the cluster can flow into a local development machine, while outgoing requests can flow back onto the cluster."
