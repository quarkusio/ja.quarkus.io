"The https://quarkus.io/blog/agentic-ai-with-quarkus/[first part] of this blog post series briefly introduced agentic AI and discussed workflow patterns.\n"
"This post will explore another kind of pattern: _agents_.\n"
"The main difference between the two is that workflow patterns are defined programmatically, while agents are more flexible and can handle a broader range of tasks.\n"
"With agents, the LLM orchestrates the sequence of steps instead of being externally orchestrated programmatically, thus reaching a higher level of autonomy and flexibility."

"Agents differ from the workflow patterns because the control flow is entirely delegated to LLMs instead of being implemented programmatically.\n"
"To successfully implement agents, the LLM must be able to reason and have access to a set of tools (_toolbox_).\n"

"From an external point of view, invoking an agent can be seen as invoking a function that opportunistically invokes tools to complete determinate subtasks."
