msgid "First, let's have a look at the big picture. When integrating an LLM into a Quarkus application, you need to describe what you want the AI to do. Unlike traditional code, you are going to explain the behavior of the AI using natural language. Of course, there are a few techniques to tame the AI, but we will explore that later."

msgid "_Document stores_ - LLMs are not good at remembering things. In addition, their context has a size limit. Thus, the extension provides a way to store and retrieve information from document stores. Before calling the LLM, the extension can ask for relevant documents in a document store and attach them to the context. The LLM can then use this data to make a decision. For instance, you can load spreadsheet data, reports, or data from a database."

Our collaboration has allowed us to provide a Quarkus-friendly approach to integrate the library (including native compilation support) and shape a new way to integrate LLMs in Quarkus applications. The current design was tailored to enable Quarkus applications to use LLM easily. You can basically hook up any of your _beans_ as tools or ingest data into a store.
