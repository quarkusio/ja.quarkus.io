msgid "Back in August we started looking into enabling GitHub discussions for community conversations. Main drivers were that we felt the community were missing a place to post about all things Quarkus - not everything is a user question or a development idea for Quarkus. In additonal all the conversations in Zulip #user chat kept growing every day but every question answered are not discoverable by search engines. Yes, StackOverflow exist, but it has issues too - thus we needed something better. Enter GitHub Discussions."
