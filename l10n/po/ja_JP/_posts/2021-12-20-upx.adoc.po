msgid "UPX is is an open-source, portable, high-performance *executable packer* initially created in 1996.  It takes an executable as input and produces a compressed executable.  Readers from a _certain_ age may have already used UPX a long time ago when programs needed to be compressed to fit on a floppy disk.  More than 20 years later, UPX is still rocking."

msgid "In Quarkus 2.6, we integrated UPX compression in the Quarkus build.  So, Quarkus can automatically produce a compressed executable.  This post explains how you can use this new feature.  But, before going further, you need to understand that **nothing comes for free**.  The compressed executable is smaller on disk, but its memory usage is higher.  So make sure to read the \"big warning\" section before using it."

msgid "UPX is available on most operating systems.  So, you should be able to download it from https://github.com/upx/upx/releases/tag/v3.96[their release page].  UPX is cross-platform.  So you can compress a Linux 64 bits executable even from a macOS or Windows machine."

msgid "If installing UPX is not an option for you, you can ask Quarkus to build your native executable using an in-container build (with `-Dquarkus.native.container-build=true`).  You will get a Linux 64 bits executable (perfect for containers but unusable from your machine if you don't use Linux).  The in-container build provides UPX so that it can compress the executable.  When using an in-container build, you don't need GraalVM or UPX on your machine.  This option is particularly interesting on CI."
