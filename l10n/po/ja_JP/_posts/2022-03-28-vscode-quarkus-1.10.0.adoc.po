We've written a fault-tolerant parser for it, provided various diagnostics, code actions, completions, and done our best to make the integration between Java source files and Qute template files very smooth. In fact, there's so much new functionality there that we plan to do a separate post entirely on Qute support within the Quarkus extension. However, there’s plenty of improvements in the Quarkus tooling as well as to the underlying MicroProfile tooling."

However, with recent updates, our underlying Java tooling support provides its own Java runtime on `win32-x64`, `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `darwin-x64`, and `darwin-arm64`. This means if you’re on such a system, ensuring the extension can locate some version of Java 11 at a minimum is no longer necessary."
