We've enabled GitHub Discussions so the community can have open communication. This gives a focal point for the community to ask and answer questions regarding the project. This means all of that great knowledge can be shared and is discoverable. Additionally, other conversations about the Quarkus Community can be had there as well. Come collaborate with us."
