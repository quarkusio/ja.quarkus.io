msgid "If proactive authentication is in use, accessing `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation.  This is because authentication might have yet to happen and accessing `SecurityIdentity` might require calls to external systems, such as databases, that might block the operation.  For blocking applications, this is not an issue.  However, if you have disabled authentication in a reactive application, this will fail because you cannot do blocking operations on the I/O thread.  To work around this, you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation` and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method.  Then, you can subscribe to the resulting `Uni` and will be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."

msgid "Some HTTP authentication mechanisms need to handle authentication exceptions themselves to create a correct authentication challenge.  For example, `io.quarkus.oidc.runtime.CodeAuthenticationMechanism`, which manages OpenID Connect (OIDC) authorization code flow authentication, needs to build a correct redirect URL, cookies, and so on.  For that reason, avoid using custom exception mappers to customize authentication exceptions thrown by such mechanisms.  Instead, a safer approach is to ensure that proactive authentication is enabled and to use Vert.x HTTP route failure handlers.  This is because events come to the handler with the correct response status and headers.  You then only need to customize the response, as shown in the following example:"
