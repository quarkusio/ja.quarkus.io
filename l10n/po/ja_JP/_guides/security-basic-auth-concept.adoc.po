msgid "HTTP Basic Authentication is one of the least resource-demanding techniques that enforce access controls to the Web resources.  It uses fields in the HTTP header and does not require HTTP cookies, session identifiers, or login pages."

msgid "An HTTP user agent, such as a web browser, uses an `Authorization` header to provide a user name and password in each HTTP request.  The header is specified as `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where credentials are the Base64 encoding of the user ID and password joined by a colon, as shown in the following example."

msgid "The Basic Authentication mechanism does not provide confidentiality protection for the transmitted credentials.  The credentials are merely encoded with Base64 when in transit and not encrypted or hashed in any way.  Therefore, Basic Authentication is used with HTTPS to provide confidentiality."

msgid "The Quarkus application must validate that usernames, passwords, and roles are managed securely.  This process, however, can introduce significant complexity to the application.  Depending on the use case, other authentication mechanisms that delegate username, password, and role management to specialized services might be a better choice."
