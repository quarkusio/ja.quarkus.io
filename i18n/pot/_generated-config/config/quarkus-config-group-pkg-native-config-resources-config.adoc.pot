"A comma separated list of globs to match resource paths that should be added "
"to the native image. \n"
" Use slash (`/`) as a path separator on all platforms. Globs must not start "
"with slash. \n"
" By default, no resources are included. \n"
" Example: Given that you have `src/main/resources/ignored.png` and "
"`src/main/resources/foo/selected.png` in your source tree and one of your "
"dependency JARs contains `bar/some.txt` file, with the following "
"configuration quarkus.native.resources.includes = "
"foo/++**++,bar/++**++/++*++.txt  the files "
"`src/main/resources/foo/selected.png` and `bar/some.txt` will be included in "
"the native image, while `src/main/resources/ignored.png` will not be "
"included. \n"
" Supported glob features   Feature Description   `++*++` Matches a (possibly "
"empty) sequence of characters that does not contain slash (`/`)   `++**++` "
"Matches a (possibly empty) sequence of characters that may contain slash "
"(`/`)   `?` Matches one character, but not slash   `++[++abc++]++` Matches "
"one character given in the bracket, but not slash   `++[++a-z++]++` Matches "
"one character from the range given in the bracket, but not slash   "
"`++[++!abc++]++` Matches one character not named in the bracket; does not "
"match slash   `++[++a-z++]++` Matches one character outside the range given "
"in the bracket; does not match slash   `++{++one,two,three++}++` Matches any "
"of the alternating tokens separated by comma; the tokens may contain "
"wildcards, nested alternations and ranges   `++\\++` The escape character   "

" Note that there are three levels of escaping when passing this option via "
