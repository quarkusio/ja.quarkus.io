"The arrival of Quarkus 1.0 brings an innovative platform for developing "
"Linux container- and kubernetes-native Java microservices. Developers "
"typically have to set aside their existing knowledge as they begin to "
"evaluate new and innovative runtime frameworks. Quarkus is different because "
"it was created by a collection of engineers with a deep expertise in a broad "
"collection of Java technologies. This includes Spring API compatibility, "
"brought to Quarkus by the same engineers that bring Spring Boot support to "
"https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes]."

"It is becoming increasingly apparent that containerization in general and "
"Kubernetes in particular is forcing a re-evaluation of Java for the "
"development of cloud native applications. Kubernetes is a highly dynamic "
"shared infrastructure that becomes more cost effective as the number of "
"applications a cluster can host grows and the responsiveness to application "
"lifecycle changes improves, like redeployments and scaling "
"up/down. Traditional Java cloud native runtimes have layered new "
"functionality on an existing stack, without really re-thinking the "
"underlying stack itself. This results in larger memory consumption and "
"slower startup times, to the point where organizations are now willing to "
"forgo their deep Java expertise to retrain and retool for Go and Node.js to "
"drive more value out of their large investment in Kubernetes clusters."

"This is the very problem that Quarkus addresses.  Quarkus is optimized for "
"memory density and rapid startup time. Quarkus applications running on the "
"JVM can deliver nearly twice as many application instances in the same "
"amount of RAM when compared to other cloud native Java stacks, and up to 7x "
"more instances when packaged as a native binary. This is more than simply "
"compiling to a native binary using "
"https://github.com/oracle/graal/tree/master/substratevm[SubstrateVM] (a "
"feature of https://www.graalvm.org/[GraalVM]). Quarkus has optimized "
"traditionally “highly dynamic” frameworks for Kubernetes immutable "
"infrastructure, resulting in reduced memory utilization and faster "
"initialization. These optimized and "
"https://quarkus.io/guides/[well-documented] frameworks, called “extensions”, "
"consist of best of breed and standard APIs. The result is "
"https://quarkus.io/assets/images/quarkus_metrics_graphic_bootmem_wide.png[significant "
"improvements in runtime efficiency]."

"Quarkus’ Spring API compatibility includes "
"https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-di-guide[Spring DI], "
"https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-web-guide[Spring Web], and "
"https://quarkus.io/guides/spring-data-jpa-guide[Spring Data JPA]. Additional "
"Spring APIs are being planned like Spring Security and Spring Config. When "
"running on the JVM, Quarkus applications can utilize virtually any Java "
"library. Many libraries, as long as they do not use Java reflection, will "
"compile to native\". Lombok, a popular library among Spring developers for "
"example, works with native compilation. To be clear, the Spring API "
"compatibility in Quarkus is not intended to be a complete Spring platform to "
"re-host existing Spring applications. The intent is to offer enough Spring "
"API compatibility to make developing new applications with Quarkus a natural "
"getting started experience. When combined with pre-optimized extensions, "
"Quarkus delivers an https://quarkus.io/guides/[amazing amount of "
"functionality] for microservices development. With all this being said, "
"developers have successfully migrated Spring applications to Quarkus :-)"

"The Spring Framework is highly dynamic in nature. To address this, the "
"Quarkus Spring compatibility extensions map Spring APIs to APIs in existing "
"extensions that have already been optimized for fast startup, reduced memory "
"utilization and native compilation, like RestEasy and CDI. Also, the Quarkus "
"Spring compatibility extensions do not utilize the Spring application "
"context. For these reasons, attempting to utilize additional Spring "
"libraries will likely not work."
