"Based in Helsinki, Finland, The Asiakastieto Group is a leading provider of "
"innovative, digital business and consumer information services in the Nordic "
"region. In the banking, financial services, and retail industries, "
"Asiakastieto’s products and services support risk management, finance and "
"business administration, credit or loan-related decision-making, sales and "
"marketing.  When the EU introduced its revised Payment Services Directive "
"(PSD2) in 2018 to increase competition, promote innovation, and improve "
"security in the payments industry, Asiakastieto began evaluating how to help "
"its customers manage the impact of the directive. This initiative aligned "
"with one of the company’s key corporate social responsibility goals: to "
"increase trust in society. The Asiakastieto Group has many brands such as UC "
"AB, Intellia Oy, and Suomen Asiakastieto Oy, the latter being the one that "
"we cover in this user story."

"Because of this, they decided to adopt microservice architectures to "
"introduce better resilience and high-availability into their solutions so "
"that if a microservice or an application went awry, it would not affect the "
"entire system. So, when the time came to start developing their PSD2 "
"project, they decided to start implementing microservices in Thorntail, "
"which is an open source application assembler - similar to Spring Boot - "
"that also implements MicroProfile, an community-driven open source "
"specification for Java microservices. They decided on Thorntail because its "
"functionality and capabilities were close to the application server "
"capabilities they were familiar with. After being in production for a few "
"months, they learned about Quarkus and its innovative approach that rethinks "
"Java for containers, cloud and Kubernetes. Around the same time, they also "
"learned about the end-of-life of Thorntail. Their continued desire to "
"develop new microservices as well as to break their monolithic application "
"servers into microservices made them evaluate Quarkus more in depth."

"With respect to their monoliths, they have about twelve JBoss EAP instances, "
"each running dozens of their applications. As a first step to make the "
"entire system more distributed, they decided to start moving some of these "
"workloads to OpenShift by running many instances of JBoss EAP, each "
"containing a single application. As a result, they experienced high memory "
"consumption. At this point, they started looking into ways to reduce the "
"footprint of these applications running on OpenShift."

"With respect to their existing Thorntail microservices, which they needed to "
"migrate to Quarkus, they noticed that spinning up a Thorntail container was "
"taking about 1 minute to start up. When they migrated it to Quarkus, the "
"service now starts in 0.4 seconds! With this improved startup time, they "
"could scale up their services faster so that they could be readily available "
"faster to process extra traffic leading to a better customer experience "
"during peak times since customers would not have to wait on the browser to "
"have their requests serviced, for example."

"According to Eero, _“migrating from Thorntail to JVM-Quarkus was trivial and "
"memory consumption went down by about 75% while CPU consumption was reduced "
"by about 70%. This was accompanied by a 40% increase in throughput resulting "
"in a faster response time. Migrating to Quarkus native, we found that the "
"application ran at a better throughput even with 50MB of memory which is 95% "
"less than with Thorntail. We also identified a space-time tradeoff between "
"different native Quarkus setups: deploying it with 200MB of memory instead "
"of 50MB will reduce its CPU requirements by two thirds. Thus, if we ever had "
"to balance CPU vs memory within our OpenShift cluster, this would prove "
"useful.”_"

"They use and like the Quarkus development mode, also known as live coding, a "
"lot. Before Quarkus, they used to use JRebel, for hot replacing but it was "
"unreliable. According to Eero _“Quarkus development mode has by far a better "
"track record.”_ Now that they are writing new microservices, they have made "
"it a best practice to use live coding. With Thorntail, there were manual "
"steps to deploy changes to try them out whereas with Quarkus, the changes "
"are automatically applied to the running process so that the developer can "
"immediately test the application. This makes developers more productive in "
"that they can verify and troubleshoot their code faster.  Eero took it upon "
"himself to deliver a small internal Quarkus workshop, which got developers "
"very excited about this new and innovative technology, _“people are looking "
"forward to working with Quarkus”_, mentioned Eero. Quarkus is getting "
"developers excited and this has led to other developers across the "
"organization to use Quarkus for their projects."

"As awesome as Quarkus is, this constantly evolving and innovative technology "
"had some areas for improvement. For example, Eero mentioned that Java API "
"for XML Web Services (JAX-WS) didn’t work on native mode. Also SSL, by "
"default, is disabled but available for HTTP/S, which he needed to use and "
"got it to work following the configuration instructions, which he found "
"complex. In addition, he would like to see improvements in how reflection is "
"currently configured, which was time-consuming to configure because he had "
"to use a trial-and-error approach to get it to work. He’d like to see a way "
"to make this reflection configuration process easier to carry out."

"Because Quarkus takes the approach of a closed world for application "
"development, there needs to be a bit of a mind shift when writing "
"applications. As an example, for their existing applications, Asiakastieto "
"used a configuration manager to read in configuration information "
"(connection URLs, DB connections strings, etc.) at application "
"startup. Since with Quarkus, in native mode, part of the application startup "
"happens during build time, they had to reconfigure the configuration manager "
"to read in the configuration information when the application was "
"run. Although the change was easy to make, it highlights the importance of "
"understanding how Quarkus applications need to be implemented under this new "
"paradigm."
