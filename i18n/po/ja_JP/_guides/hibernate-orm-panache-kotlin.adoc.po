"Hibernate ORM is the de facto standard JPA implementation and is well-known "
"in the Java ecosystem.  Panache offers a new layer atop this familiar "
"framework.  This guide will not dive in to the specifics of either as those "
"are already covered in the link:hibernate-orm-panache[Panache guide].  In "
"this guide, we'll cover the Kotlin specific changes needed to use Panache in "
"your Kotlin-based Quarkus applications."

"As we saw in the Panache guide, Panache allows us to extend the "
"functionality in our entities and repositories (also known as DAOs) with "
"some automatically provided functionality.  When using Kotlin, the approach "
"is very similar to what we see in the Java version with a slight change or "
"two.  To Panache-enable your entity, you would define it something like:"
