"Quarkus platform descriptor is a JSON artifact that provides information "

"quarkus.io and the Quarkus command line tools consult this descriptor to "
"list, add and remove extensions to/from the project on user's request.  This "
"artifact is also used as a Quarkus platform identifier. When Quarkus tools "
"need to identify the Quarkus platform(s) used in the project, they will "
"analyze the dependency version constraints of the project (the effective "
"list of the managed dependencies from the `dependencyManagement` section in "
"Maven terms) looking for the platform descriptor artifact(s) among them. "
"Given that the platform descriptors are included into the Quarkus platform "
"BOMs, every Quarkus application will inherit the platform descriptor "
"artifact from the imported platform BOM(s) as a dependency version "
"constraint (managed dependency in Maven terms)."

"The classifier matching the version of the platform may look confusing at "
"first. But this is what turns the descriptor into a true \"fingerprint\" of "
"the platform. In both Maven and Gradle, the effective set of the dependency "
"version constraints (or the managed dependencies) is obtained by merging all "
"the imported BOMs and version constraints specified individually in the "
"current project and also its parent(s). The artifact `classifier` is a part "
"of the dependency ID, which could be expressed as `groupId:artifactId:"
"classifier:type`. Which means that if a project is based on a couple of "
"Quarkus platforms (by importing their BOMs), e.g. `io.quarkus:quarkus-"
"universe-bom::pom:1.2.3` and `org.acme:acme-bom::pom:555`, and these two "
"platforms are based on different `io.quarkus:quarkus-bom::pom` versions "
"(which is technically a Quarkus platform in its turn as well), the Quarkus "
"tools will be able to detect this fact and make the user aware of it, since "
"it *might* not be a safe combination. If the descriptor artifact didn't "
"include the classifer containing the version of the platform then the tools "
"wouldn't be able to detect a potentially incompatible mix of different "
"versions of the same platform in the same project."
