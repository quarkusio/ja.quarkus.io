msgid "Quarkus provides form based authentication that works in a similar manner to traditional Servlet form based auth. Unlike traditional form authentication, the authenticated user is not stored in an HTTP session, as Quarkus does not provide clustered HTTP session support. Instead the authentication information is stored in an encrypted cookie, which can be read by all members of the cluster (provided they all share the same encryption key)."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_guides/security-built-in-authentication.adoc:35
msgid "The encryption key can be set using the `quarkus.http.auth.session.encryption-key` property, and it must be at least 16 characters long. This key is hashed using SHA-256 and the resulting digest is used as a key for AES-256 encryption of the cookie value. This cookie contains an expiry time as part of the encrypted value, so all nodes in the cluster must have their clocks synchronized. At one minute intervals a new cookie will be generated with an updated expiry time if the session is in use."

msgid "If you disable proactive authentication then the authentication process will only be run when an identity is requested, either because there are security rules that requires the user to be authenticated, or due to programatic access to the current identity."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_guides/security-built-in-authentication.adoc:124
msgid "Note that if proactive authentication is in use accessing the `SecurityIdentity` is a blocking operation. This is because authentication may not have happened yet, and accessing it may require calls to external systems such as databases that may block. For blocking applications this is no problem, however if you are have disabled authentication in a reactive application this will fail (as you cannot do blocking operations on the IO thread). To work around this you need to `@Inject` an instance of `io.quarkus.security.identity.CurrentIdentityAssociation`, and call the `Uni<SecurityIdentity> getDeferredIdentity();` method. You can then subscribe to the resulting `Uni` and will be notified when authentication is complete and the identity is available."
