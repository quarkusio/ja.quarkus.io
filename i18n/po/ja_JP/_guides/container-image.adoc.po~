"The extension `quarkus-container-image-jib` is powered by "
"https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib[Jib] for performing container "
"image builds.  The major benefit of using Jib with Quarkus is that all the "
"dependencies (everything found under `target/lib`) are cached in a different "
"layer than the actual application making rebuilds really fast and small "
"(when it comes to pushing).  Another important benefit of using this "
"extension is that it provides the ability to create a container image "
"without having to have any dedicated client side tooling (like Docker) or "
"running daemon processes (like the Docker daemon)  when all that is needed "
"is the ability to push to a container image registry."

"In situations where all that is needed to build a container image and no "
"push to a registry is necessary (essentially by having set "
"`quarkus.container-image.build=true` and left `quarkus.container-image.push` "
"unset - it defaults to `false`), then this extension creates a container "
"image and registers it with the Docker daemon. This means that although "
"Docker isn't used to build the image, it is nevertheless necessary. Also "
"note that using this mode, the built container image *will* show up when "
"executing `docker images`."

"There are cases when additional files (other than ones produced by the "

"cases, Quarkus copies any file under `src/main/jib` into the built container "
"image (which is essentially the same idea that the Jib Maven and Gradle "
"plugins support).  For example, the presence of `src/main/jib/foo/bar` would "
"result in `/foo/bar` being added into the container filesystem."
