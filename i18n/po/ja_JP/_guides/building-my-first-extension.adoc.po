msgid "Quarkus extensions enhance your application just as projects dependencies do.  The role of the extensions is to leverage Quarkus paradigms to integrate seamlessly a library into Quarkus architecture - e.g. do more things at build time.  This is how you can use your battle-tested ecosystem and take advantage of Quarkus performance and native compilation.  Go to https://code.quarkus.io/[code.quarkus.io] to get the list of the supported extensions."
