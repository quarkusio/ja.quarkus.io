msgid "Quarkus Funqy is part of Quarkus's serverless strategy and aims to provide a portable Java API to write functions deployable to various FaaS environments like AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Knative, and Knative Events (Cloud Events).  It is also usable as a standalone service."

msgid "Because Funqy is an abstraction that spans multiple different cloud/function providers and protocols it has to be a very simple API and thus, might not have all the features you are used to in other remoting abstractions.  A nice side effect though is that Funqy is as optimized and as small as possible.  This means that because Funqy sacrifices a little bit on flexibility, you'll get a framework that has little to no overhead."

The Java type that is declared as the parameter or return type is the type that will be expected by the Funqy runtime.  Funqy does type introspection at build time to speed up boot time, so any derived types will not be noticed by the Funqy marshalling layer at runtime."

msgid "REST over HTTP has become a very common way to write services over the past decade.  While Funqy\nhas an HTTP binding it is not a replacement for REST.  Because Funqy has to work across a variety\nof protocols and function cloud platforms, it is very minimalistic and constrained.  For example, if you\nuse Funqy you lose the ability to link (think URIs) to the data your functions spit out.  You also\nlose the ability to leverage cool HTTP features like `cache-control` and conditional GETs.  Many\ndevelopers will be ok with that as many won't be using these REST/HTTP features or styles. You'll\nhave to make the decision on what camp you are in.  Quarkus does support REST integration (through JAX-RS,\n Spring MVC, Vert.x Web, and Servlet) with\nvarious cloud/function providers, but there are some disadvantages of using that approach as well.  For example,\nif you want to do link:amazon-lambda-http[HTTP with AWS Lambda], this requires you to use the AWS API Gateway which may\nslow down deployment and cold start time or even cost you more.\n"

#: upstream/_guides/funqy.adoc:188
msgid "The purpose of Funqy is to allow you to write cross-provider functions so that you can move off of your current function provider if, for instance, they start charging you a lot more for their service.  Another reason you might not want to use Funqy is if you need access specific APIs of the target function environment.  For example, developers often want access to the AWS Context on Lambda.  In this case, we tell them they may be better off using the link:amazon-lambda[Quarkus Amazon Lambda] integration instead."
