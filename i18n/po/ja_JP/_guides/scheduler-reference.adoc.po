msgid   "Modern applications often need to run specific tasks periodically.  There are two scheduler extensions in Quarkus.  The `quarkus-scheduler` extension brings the API and a lightweight in-memory scheduler implementation.  The `quarkus-quartz` extension implements the API from the `quarkus-scheduler` extension and contains a scheduler implementation based on the Quartz library.  You will only need `quarkus-quartz` for more advanced scheduling use cases, such as persistent tasks, clustering and programmatic scheduling of jobs."
