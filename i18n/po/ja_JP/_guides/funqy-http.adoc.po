"The Funqy HTTP binding is not a replacement for REST over HTTP.  Because "
"Funqy needs to be portable across a lot of different protocols and function "
"providers its HTTP binding is very minimalistic and you will lose REST "
"features like linking and the ability to leverage HTTP features like cache-"
"control and conditional GETs.  You may want to consider using Quarkus's JAX-"
"RS, Spring MVC, or Vert.x Web Reactive Routes support instead, although "
"Funqy will have less overhead than these alternatives (except Vert.x which "
"is still super fast)."
