msgid "During the creation of the MicroProfile Metrics specification in 2017, Dropwizard Metrics was the most popular metrics library at that time.  It was a natural fit for MicroProfile to use DropWizard Metrics as inspiration for a metrics specification."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:30
msgid "During the last 3-4 years, there's been a growing focus on the needs of Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) in monitoring the operations of many varied services.  This focus leads to driving simplicity and ease of use to the SRE world.  We don't want make the life of an SRE harder!"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:35
msgid "The design and development of Micrometer focused on the needs of SREs from the very beginning.  A key aspect to that approach is separating out the metric implementation into the registries, enabling different registries to customize how the metric export, aligning with a specific monitoring tool."

#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:41
msgid "Micrometer was built to adapt to the changing cloud native landscape while presenting a steady API for applications and libraries to use.  Each MeterRegistry implementation encapsulates its specific aggregation and reporting requirements.  There are MeterRegistry implementations available for cloud monitoring systems like Prometheus and Statsd, as well as service providers like Datadog, New Relic or Stackdriver.  You can include more than one of these registries at the same time, too."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:46
msgid "While Micrometer has an API for applications to use, practical usage is more focused on the MeterBinder abstraction.  MeterBinders allow instrumentation for application libraries to be added later.  It is even better when your application framework can register discovered MeterBinders on your behalf."

#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:52
msgid "Micrometer does follow different naming conventions than Dropwizard or MP Metrics, for a few reasons.  First, it uses a dot notation for all metric names, e.g. my.metric.name.  Each registry implementation can then apply its own naming convention to convert that name into something that matches its convention.  The Prometheus MeterRegistry converts my.metric.name into my_metric_name, for example.  Second, Micrometer was built around the notion of dimensional metrics, rather than adapting to it later."

#: upstream/_posts/2020-10-19-micrometer-metrics.adoc:57
msgid "Another benefit to using Micrometer is its usage in the wider Java ecosystem.  Spring Boot and Micronaut both use Micrometer, amongst others.  In an environment where SREs are monitoring instances of different Java frameworks, having them all produce metrics with the same names and dimensions is incredibly beneficial."
