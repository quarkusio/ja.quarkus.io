These retailers are now aggressively moving to cloud-native and microservice architectures which has led them to explore alternative languages to Java which would require hiring or retraining developers."

Traditional COTS (commercial-off-the-shelf) systems such as order management and e-commerce are not allowing our customers to scale and be agile. Consequently, they are being replaced by microservices in order to scale and provide the agility needed to compete with digital retailers."

msgid "A lot of Wipro customers use Java frameworks like Jakarta EE and Spring for enterprise development. The limitations of Java were magnified as they moved to a microservices architecture in the cloud. The memory consumption and startup times required the need for bigger containers and VMs. Their customers had already started looking at Java alternatives such as Golang and Node.js which meant that they would have to retrain their employees and take time to learn a new language."

The Wipro team utilized a number of extensions including RESTEasy, Hibernate ORM, Spring compatibility, PostgreSQL, and more. The Apache Camel extensions were particularly useful for reducing the time and complexity for integration development efforts. The Camel extensions allowed them to quickly write abstraction and anti-corruption layers on top of legacy applications like mainframes and COTS applications."

The Quarkus Spring compatibility extensions allowed them to easily port the application in less than a week with minimal issues."

msgid "Wipro also sees a big opportunity for Quarkus to enable Java developers to create event-driven, serverless applications. Retailers utilize a lot of task processing events as part of batch jobs or real time processing to accept and fulfill orders. “Always on” services are typically used for these tasks and they consume resources even when there is no load.  For example, a retail customer in the United Kingdom receives allocations from a SaaS provider three times a day that utilizes four services running 24x7. By shifting the processing to serverless, the retailer saved significant processing cycles by paying only for the CPU cycles when there is an allocation activity."
