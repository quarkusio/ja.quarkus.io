And Quarkus is known to build on top of \"Best of Breed Libraries and Standards\".  That's true.  On the other hand, the Quarkus community is also a powerful innovation catalyst.  And so we decided to start Qute (QUarkus TEmplates) - a templating engine designed specifically to meet the Quarkus needs.  We believe that we can bring new ideas even to such an explored area as the templating is."

This allows for better resource utilization and fits the Quarkus reactive model.  Another consequence of this design decision is that it's possible to leverage non-blocking clients directly from a template, i.e. to asynchronously fetch data from various sources."

On the other hand, a user is not protected from tedious errors caused by typos and various refactoring consequences.  Qute templates can be _optionally_ type-safe.  What does it actually mean? A template may contain one or more *parameter declarations*.  A parameter declaration binds a concrete type information to a given identifier in the current context.
