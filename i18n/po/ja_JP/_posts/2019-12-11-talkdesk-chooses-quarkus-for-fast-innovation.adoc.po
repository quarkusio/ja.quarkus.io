msgid   "Customers can spin up their own cloud contact center as a service platform. Talkdesk had been mostly a Ruby shop. When the customer base started to grow, the product architecture required a change to support higher concurrency, CPU intensive workloads, ecosystem support and better hireability. The company started to look into alternatives and decided to invest in technologies like Kotlin and Spring in 2017. In early 2019, with the desire to create new products and maintain their competitive edge, Talkdesk opened a new innovation office for research and development (R&D) in Coimbra, Portugal. The impetus of this new office was to create new solutions."

The same week that they were evaluating frameworks, Quarkus was introduced to the market. The list of Quarkus extensions was very attractive to them due to their familiarity with the APIs, as well as the included functionality."

Troubleshooting the entire system was also improved since end-to-end debugging (from Java stack to R and Python) could be done directly from Quarkus."

The learning curve was small because of the familiarity that Talkdesk developers had with the Quarkus extensions. The implementation of the first 4 Quarkus microservices, which was part of their innovation initiative, took a total of 6 months from kickoff to production: 3 months working on the prototype, followed by 3 months for internal release to production. They use a test-driven development approach and to this end they make use of the built-in Quarkus Tests capabilities."

msgid   "Quarkus has helped Talkdesk to streamline their development process with a familiar environment by providing a set of technologies well known to their developers, like Hibernate ORM, MicroProfile, Camel, Kubernetes, etc. It has also helped them with their test-driven development approach by leveraging Quarkus built-in testing harness. This combination resulted in a fast 2-week ramp-up to high developer productivity due a very small learning curve and existing expertise of the Quarkus extensions. In addition, the generation of a single small JAR with “just your code”, less memory consumption and faster startup times in JVM and native modes make Quarkus very interesting for the cloud and containers. All of this has allowed Talkdesk to maintain their continued competitive edge in the market."

Talkdesk tests most features via Quarkus Tests, which they find very valuable. Not only does the built-in Quarkus testing harness allows their developers to quickly and easily include tests into their code but it also encourages developers to follow Talkdesks’s established test-driven development best practices. Developers are free to use development mode but they are encouraged to write Quarkus Tests first."

msgid   "Furthermore, their ability to wrap R scripts and Python with MicroProfile (MicroProfile is calling the GraalVM API to invoke R and Python) is giving them a competitive edge because they can write code fast and debug even faster since they have everything running on the same JVM. They are able to use MicroProfile JWT, MicroProfile Config, and MicroProfile Fault Tolerance, etc. across all microservices including the ones that call R and Python. They don’t need to use different security mechanisms for Python and R, for example. They use MicroProfile APIs as a way to standardize approaches to security, Fault Tolerance, Config, etc. across all microservices. And this benefit allows their data scientists to continue to use their favorite tools in R or Python to write their code."
