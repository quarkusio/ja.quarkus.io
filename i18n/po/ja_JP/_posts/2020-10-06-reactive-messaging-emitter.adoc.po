The downstream component consuming the message are part of a _Reactive Streams_.  Passing the message immediately would violate the Reactive Streams protocol.  We must be sure that the downstream components are ready to accept this message.  As a result, the emitter is not pushing the message directly, but enqueue it in a buffer used to handle the downstream capacity (requests in Reactive Streams lingo)."

Then, you cannot emit anymore, and attempting to emit will throw exceptions.  But what can we do in this case? When injecting the emitter, you can configure an Overflow strategy.  For example, you can set the buffer size, use an unbounded buffer, drop the messages, fail, or just ignore the back pressure and let the downstream handle it.  By default, it uses a buffer, but depending on your use case, you may want to configure it differently:"
