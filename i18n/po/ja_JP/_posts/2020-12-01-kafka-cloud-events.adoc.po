msgid "First, let's look at the why.  Events are everywhere.  Many modern systems are using events one way or another.  Events can be used to implement event sourcing, communicate facts, trigger out-of-band processing, or send notifications.  Events become an essential piece of any system."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-12-01-kafka-cloud-events.adoc:29
msgid "Yet event publishers tend to describe events differently.  I don't mean the content is different, but the envelope and the event's format are heterogeneous, even if these events transit on the same event mesh.  Some applications choose JSON and encode everything in the event's payload; some other systems prefer binary formats, such as Avro or Protobuf, and use the protocol capability, such as headers or properties, to transport metadata about the wrapped payload.  While event-driven architecture claims to ease the integration with external systems, this disparity is doing the opposite.  It's not rare to need a specific event translator with the only purpose to adapt events from one format to another."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-12-01-kafka-cloud-events.adoc:36
msgid "So, what's Cloud Event? Cloud Event proposes a common way to describe events.  The goal is, obviously, interoperability and easing the integration burden.  Cloud Event 1.0 was released almost a year ago.  Over the past year, many Cloud Providers adopted this format, such as Azure and Oracle.  Several middlewares have also added support for Cloud Events, such as Knative, Kogito, Debezium, and Quarkus."

msgid "First, the `specversion` indicates which version of Cloud Event it is using (1.0).  The `id` field provides an id for that specific event.  The `source` attribute is a URI identifying the event source, i.e., the context in which an event happened or the application that emitted that specific event.  Combining the `id` and the `source` provides a unique identifier.  Such uniqueness is essential to implement idempotence and handle potential duplicates.  The `type` is the last mandatory attribute.  It indicates the _type_ of the event.  Here, I use the fully qualified class name, but you can imagine anything.  It should refer to the kind of event you have defined in your system."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2020-12-01-kafka-cloud-events.adoc:75
msgid "The other attributes are optional.  `datacontenttype` defines the content-type of the `data` attribute.  `subject` allows passing extra details about the event, such as an additional hint about the context or the type of event.  `time` is a timestamp, generally indicating the creation time.  There is another optional attribute not used in my example.  The `dataschema` attribute lets you pass the schema of the event data."
