msgid "The Quarkus project moves fast and when we prepare bugfix releases, we usually have several dozens of pull requests to backport.  The number of pull requests to backport is enormous and doing it via the GitHub UI is inconvenient and takes a lot of time (click PR, copy/paste commit hashes to cherry-pick, remove label, assign milestone, assign milestone to all fixed issues, next) plus some limitation of the UI (it's not possible to sort by merge date to avoid conflicts, for example).  So we decided to automate this work, and built an application.  Of course, with Quarkus!"

Applying the changes introduced by these pull-requests (aka. _cherry-picking_) is simplified by providing a button next to each pull-request to copy the necessary `git cherry-pick` commands to the clipboard - we prefer this step to be done manually by the Release engineer."
