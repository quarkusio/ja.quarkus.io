It supports failure handling, both sequential and parallel operation composition, and plenty of operators.  Reactive programming promotes data streams as a primary construct, and your code is observing streams and reacting to signals."

When that upstream provides a `Subscription` to our Processor, it can give a `Subscription` to the Subscriber.  All these interactions are asynchronous.  When this handshake completes, the `Subscriber` can start requesting items.  The Processor is responsible for mediating the `Subscriber` requests with its upstream.  For example, as illustrated in the picture above, if the `Subscriber` requires two items, the `Processor` also requests two items to its own upstream.  Of course, depending on the `Processor` code, it may not be that simple.  What's fundamental is that each `Publisher` and `Processor` enforces the flowing requests never to overload downstream Subscribers."

But it's not always the case.  Streams representing physical entities are rarely controllable.  Imagine a stream emitting user's keystrokes.  You cannot ask the users to slow down.  That would be a terrible user experience.  As we have seen above, time is also not something we can slow down, unfortunately...  In this case, the `onOverflow()` group lets you decide the mitigation, such as using buffers or dropping items."
