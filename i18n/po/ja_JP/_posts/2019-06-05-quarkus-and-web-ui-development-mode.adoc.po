Since Quarkus has no knowledge of anything called `/rest` you end up with a 404 (Not Found) status. The filter checks the status code of the request after calling `chain.doFilter()`. If the status is 404 and does not seem to be a file, we forward this request to `/`, which in turn serves up the `index.html` file. By doing a forward the path and parameters of the request are preserved. Angular then figures out that `/rest` is one of its known routes and displays the appropriate page of the application. Once the web application is loaded in the browser, Angular takes over and handles all the internal links to other routes in the web application (as an example, if you are on http://localhost:8080 and click on the link taking you to http://localhost:8080/other there is no round-trip to the server)."
