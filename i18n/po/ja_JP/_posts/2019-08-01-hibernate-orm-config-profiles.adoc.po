msgid "Quarkus live coding (aka dev mode) is really useful for applications that mix front end or services and database access.  There are a few common approaches to make the best of it."

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2019-08-01-hibernate-orm-config-profiles.adoc:18
msgid "The first choice is to use `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create` in conjunction with `import.sql`.  That way for every change to your app and in particular to your entities, the database schema will be properly recreated and your data fixture (stored in `import.sql`) will be used to repopulate it from scratch.  This is best to perfectly control your environment and works magic with Quarkus live coding mode: your entity changes or any change to your `import.sql` is immediately picked up and the schema updated without restarting the application!"

#. type: Plain text
#: upstream/_posts/2019-08-01-hibernate-orm-config-profiles.adoc:23
msgid "By default, Hibernate ORM, upon boot, will read and execute the SQL statements in the `/import.sql` file (if present).  You can change the file name by changing the property `quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script` in `application.properties`."

#: upstream/_posts/2019-08-01-hibernate-orm-config-profiles.adoc:33
msgid "The second approach is to use `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=update`.  This approach is best when you do many entity changes but still need to work on a copy of the production data or if you want to reproduce a bug that is based on specific database entries.  `update` is a best effort from Hibernate ORM and will fail in specific situations including altering your database structure which could lead to data loss.  For example if you change structures related to the foreign key, Hibernate ORM might have to bail out.  But for development, these limitations are acceptable."

#: upstream/_posts/2019-08-01-hibernate-orm-config-profiles.adoc:38
msgid "The third approach is to use `quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=none`.  This approach is best when you are working on a copy of the production data but want to fully control the schema evolution.  Or if you use a database schema migration tool like https://quarkus.io/guides/flyway[Flyway].  When you make a change to an entity, make sure to adapt the database schema accordingly."

You can define different https://quarkus.io/guides/config#configuration-profiles[configuration profiles] to select different behaviors depending on your environment.  This is great because you can define different combinations of Hibernate ORM properties matching the development style you currently need."
