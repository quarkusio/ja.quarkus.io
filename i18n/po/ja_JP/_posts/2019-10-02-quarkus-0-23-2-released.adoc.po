msgid   "Last week, we released link:/blog/quarkus-0-23-1-released/[Quarkus 0.23.1] which paved the way towards our new Vert.x based HTTP layer and brought a lot of new features (see link:/blog/quarkus-0-23-1-released/[the original announcement post] for all the details).  We discovered a memory usage regression shortly after the release: it was not a memory leak or anything that bad but an increased memory usage due to Netty getting a bit too comfortable."
