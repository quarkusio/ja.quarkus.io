msgid "Mutiny is an event-driven Reactive Programming library.  Like other reactive programming libraries, it uses streams as the primary construct.  These streams convey events, and your code processes these events.  Most of the time, your code is only interested in item and failure events.  But there are other kinds of events such as cancellation, request, completion, and so on."

msgid "For each kind of event, there is an associated _group_ providing the methods to handle that specific event: `onItem()`, `onFailure()`, `onCompletion()` and so on.  These groups provide two methods to peek at the various events without impacting its distribution: `invoke` and `call`.  It does not transform the received event; it notifies you that something happened and let you react."
