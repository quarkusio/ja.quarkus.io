msgid "I had the question multiple times: how do I use Eclipse Vert.x in Quarkus? Indeed, you can use Vert.x in Quarkus.  You can deploy _verticles_, communicate with the event bus, or use anything from the Vert.x ecosystem.  But, you can also use the Mutiny variant of Vert.x in Quarkus, and get a seamless experience with the other reactive APIs offered by Quarkus.  Several posts have already mentioned this, but it deserves a specific blog post.  So, here we are."
