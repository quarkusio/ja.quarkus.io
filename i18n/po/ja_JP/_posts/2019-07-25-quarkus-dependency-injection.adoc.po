The rules are described in the https://quarkus.io/guides/cdi-reference#remove_unused_beans[reference guide] but simply said: if a bean is not injected anywhere and cannot be reached in any other standard way (e.g. observer notification) it is removed.  Moreover, users can instruct the container to not remove a bean by annotating the bean class with `@io.quarkus.arc.Unremovable`.  Finally, this optimization can be disabled and fine tuned by using the `quarkus.arc.remove-unused-beans` property."
