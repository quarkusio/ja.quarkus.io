msgid "Quarkus and Eclipse MicroProfile are a great basis for building Kafka Streams applications.  The Quarkus extension for Kafka Streams comes with everything needed to run stream processing pipelines on the JVM as well as in native mode via GraalVM.  The MicroProfile APIs for health checks and metrics can be used to expose the right information for gaining insight into running stream processing applications."
