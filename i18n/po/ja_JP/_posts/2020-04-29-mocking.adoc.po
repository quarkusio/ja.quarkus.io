msgid "Testing Quarkus applications has been an important part of the Quarkus Developer Joy, which is why `@QuarkusTest` for testing JVM applications and `@NativeTest` for black-box testing of the native images have been part of Quarkus since the first release.  A recurring request however amongst our community members has been to have Quarkus allow them to selectively mock certain CDI beans for specific tests. This post will introduce the new mocking capabilities that `1.4` brings which aim to address those concerns, while also providing a glimpse of additional improvements in this are that will be part of `1.5`."
