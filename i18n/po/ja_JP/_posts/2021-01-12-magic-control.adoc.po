msgid "Just before my PTO, someone told me: '_I don't like magic._' In this context, _magic_ refers to the amount of hidden _stuff_ done by Quarkus under the hood for the sake of simplicity.  It includes dependency injection, annotations, and so on."

msgid "It's not the first time that I get that kind of comment, and coming from the Vert.x project, it makes sense.  Vert.x has (almost) no magic, and for a good reason: too much magic can be terrible and make production tuning utterly expensive.  Sometimes you want to have more control and avoid unexpected behaviors: execute the code you wrote, and nothing else."

msgid "But magic is not inherently bad.  Magic is power that can be used for good or for bad.  After all, your application runs on a silicon with microcode magic powering an Operating System with abstraction magic powering the Java Virtual Machine with Just In Time magic.  There is magic, it's just magic you have enough knowledge (or trust) of vs magic you don't."

msgid "You may think that Quarkus has a lot of magic tricks.  It is true in some sense but it is easily understood and comes with strong benefits in either memory optimization, startup time optimization or last but not least developer experience improvements.  You can decide the amount of magic that you want and the amount of control you feel comfortable with.  You don't have to use dependency injection or managed clients if you prefer doing things yourself."
