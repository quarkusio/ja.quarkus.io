msgid "At the beginning of the Mutiny adventure, my friend Alex came to me with an interesting problem.  Alex wanted to retrieve data from a REST service in a reactive manner.  So far, no problem, we have everything for this in our toolbox.  But, this service, as many services, is using pagination.  Ah! That makes things a bit more spicy.  Alex wanted to retrieve all the items and consume them as a stream, but you can't retrieve the items in one batch.  You need to invoke the service for every page, extract the items and feed the stream."

First, we passed the `page` query parameter, indicating which page we want.  Generally, when you retrieve a page, the API provides a way to know if there is a next page (a special field in the JSON document, or HTTP header), but the Punk API does not provide any hint.  So, to retrieve all the beers, we need to invoke the service for page 1, 2, 3... until the returned JSON array is empty."
