msgid   "At the time SmallRye Fault Tolerance was born, https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Hystrix] was still a thing and was chosen to be the core of the implementation.  The choice turned out to be sub-optimal. The library itself is not developed anymore.  Moreover, changes in the MicroProfile Fault Tolerance specification made it impossible to satisfy the specification with a Hystrix-based solution.  It led us to the conclusion that we need to eliminate Hystrix."
